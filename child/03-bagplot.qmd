## Bagplots

<!-- NOTES
@Rousseeuw-etal:2012

The bagplot consists of three nested polygons, called the "bag", the "fence", and the "loop".

* The inner polygon, called the bag, is constructed on the basis of Tukey depth, the smallest number of observations that can be contained by a half-plane that also contains a given point.[4] It contains at most 50% of the data points
* The outermost of the three polygons, called the fence is not drawn as part of the bagplot, but is used to construct it. It is formed by inflating the bag by a certain factor (usually 3). Observations outside the fence are flagged as outliers.[5]
* The observations that are not marked as outliers are surrounded by a loop, the convex hull of the observations within the fence.

Another very nice non-parametric idea to display bivariate density is a 2D generalization of a boxplot called
a **bagplot**, introduced by @Rousseeuw-etal:2012.
