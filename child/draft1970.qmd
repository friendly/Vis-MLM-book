## Shaken, not stirred

The power of graphics is particularly evident when data contains a weak signal embedded in a field of noise. To the casual glance, there may seem to be nothing going on, but the signal can be made apparent in an incisive graph.

A dramatic example of this occurred in 1969 when the U.S. military conducted a lottery, the first since World War II,
to determine which young men would be called up to serve in the Vietnam War for 1970. The U.S. Selective Service had devised a system to rank eligible men according to a random drawing of their birthdays. 
There were 366 blue plastic capsules containing birth dates placed in a transparent glass container and drawn by hand to assign ranked order-of-call numbers to all men within the 18-26 age range.

```{r}
#| label: draft-lottery-photo
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Congressman Alexander Pirnie (R-NY) drawing the first capsule for the Selective Service draft, Dec 1, 1969. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_lottery_(1969)#/media/File:1969_draft_lottery_photo.jpg"
knitr::include_graphics("images/1969_draft_lottery_photo.jpg")
```

In an attempt to make the selection process also transparent, the proceeding was
covered on radio, TV and film and the dates posted in order on a large display board.
The first capsule---drawn by Congressman Alexander Pirnie (R-NY) of the House Armed Services Committee---contained the date September 14, so all men born on September 14 in any year between 1944 and 1950 were assigned lottery number 1. 
April 24 was drawn next, then December 30, February 14, and so on until June 8,
selected last.
I watched this with considerable interest because I was eligible for the Draft that
year, and was dismayed when my birthday, May 7, came up ranked 35. Ugh!


The data are contained in the dataset `Draft1970` in the
**vcdExtra** package ordered by `Month` and birthdate (`Day`).

```{r draft-data}
library(ggplot2)
data(Draft1970, package = "vcdExtra")
dplyr::glimpse(Draft1970)
```

A basic scatterplot, slightly prettified, is shown in @fig-draft-gg1. 
The ranks do seem to be completely random.  Is there any reason to suspect
a flaw in the selection process, as I firmly hoped at the time?
If you stare at the graph long enough, you can make out a sparsity of points in the
upper right corner and lower left corner compared to the opposite corners.
```{r}
#| label: draft-gg1
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
#| code-fold: show
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: "Basic scatterplot of 1970 Draft Lottery data plotting rank order of selection against birthdates in the year. Points are colored by month. The horizontal line is at the average rank."
# make markers for months at their mid points
months <- data.frame(
  month =unique(Draft1970$Month),
  mid = seq(15, 365-15, by = 30))

ggplot2:: theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 16))
gg <- ggplot(Draft1970, aes(x = Day, y = Rank)) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5, shape = 21, 
             alpha = 0.3, 
             color = "black", 
             aes(fill=Month)
             ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rainbow(12)) +
  geom_text(data=months, aes(x=mid, y=0, label=month)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ 1,
              col = "black", fill="grey", alpha=0.6) +
  labs(x = "Day of the year",
       y = "Lottery rank") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
gg
```

But, fitting a line or smoothed (loess) curve shows a definite trend to lower 
ranks for birthdays toward the end of the year:

```{r}
#| label: draft-gg2
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
#| code-fold: show
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: "Enhanced scatterplot of 1970 Draft Lottery data adding a linear regression line and loess smooth."
ggplot(Draft1970, aes(x = Day, y = Rank)) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5, shape = 21, 
             alpha = 0.3, 
             color = "black", 
             fill = "brown") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y~1,
              se = FALSE,
              col = "black", fill="grey", alpha=0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y~x,
              color = "blue", se = FALSE,
              alpha=0.25) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y~x,
              color = "darkgreen",
              fill = "darkgreen", 
              alpha=0.25) +
  labs(x = "Day of the year",
       y = "Lottery rank")

```

Is this a real effect? 
<!-- The Spearman $\rho$ rank correlation between -->
<!-- `Rank` and `Day` is significantly negative: -->

<!-- ```{r spearman} -->
<!-- stats::cor.test(~ Rank + Day, data=Draft1970, method="spearman") |>  -->
<!--   purrr::pluck("estimate") -->
<!-- ``` -->
 
Even though the points seem to be random over the year, linear regression of `Rank` on `Day` shows a highly significant negative effect even though the 
correlation is small ($R^2 = 0.051$) The slope, -0.226,
means that for each additional day in the year decreases about 1/4 rank toward
the front of the draft line, nearly 7 ranks per month.
On average,
```{r draft-mod}
draft.mod <- lm(Rank ~ Day, data=Draft1970)
summary(draft.mod)
```


### What happened here?

Previous draft lotteries carried out by drawing capsules from a container had occasionally suffered the embarrassment of an empty capsule being selected 
because of vigorous mixing [@Fienberg:71] So for the 1970 lottery, the birthdate capsules were
put in cardboard boxes, one for each month and these were carefully emptied into the glass container in order of month: Jan., Feb., ... Dec., gently shaken in atop the pile already there.  All might have been well had the persons drawing the capsules
put their hand in in a random fashion, but generally picked from toward the top.
