### Shaken, not stirred: The 1970 Draft Lottery {#sec-draft1970}

>Although we often hear that data speak for themselves, their voices can be soft and sly.---Frederick Mosteller (1983), _Beginning Statistics with Data Analysis_, p. 234.

The power of graphics is particularly evident when data contains a weak signal embedded in a field of noise. To the casual glance, there may seem to be nothing going on, but the signal can be made apparent in an incisive graph.

A dramatic example of this occurred in 1969 when the U.S. military conducted a lottery, the first since World War II,
to determine which young men would be called up to serve in the Vietnam War for 1970. The U.S. Selective Service had devised a system to rank eligible men according to a random drawing of their birthdays. 
There were 366 blue plastic capsules containing birth dates placed in a transparent glass container and drawn by hand to assign ranked order-of-call numbers to all men within the 18-26 age range.

```

In an attempt to make the selection process also transparent, the proceeding was
covered on radio, TV and film and the dates posted in order on a large display board.
The first capsule---drawn by Congressman Alexander Pirnie (R-NY) of the House Armed Services Committee---contained the date September 14, so all men born on September 14 in any year between 1944 and 1950 were assigned lottery number 1,
and would be drafted first.
April 24 was drawn next, then December 30, February 14, and so on until June 8,
selected last. At the time of the drawing, US officials stated that those with birthdays drawn in the first third
would almost certainly be drafted, while those in the last third would probably avoid the draft [@Fienberg:71].

I watched this unfold with considerable interest because I was eligible for the Draft that
year. I was dismayed when my birthday, May 7, came up ranked 35. Ugh!


The data, from the official [Selective Service listing](https://www.sss.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1970-Vietnam-Lottery.pdf)
are contained in the dataset `vcdExtra::Draft1970`, ordered by `Month` and birthdate (`Day`),
with `Rank` as the order in which the birthdates were drawn.

```{r draft-data}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
data(Draft1970, package = "vcdExtra")
dplyr::glimpse(Draft1970)
```

A basic scatterplot, slightly prettified, is shown in @fig-draft-gg1. 
The points are colored by month, and month labels are shown at the bottom.

```{r}
#| label: fig-draft-gg1
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| fig-cap: "Basic scatterplot of 1970 Draft Lottery data plotting rank order of selection against birthdates in the year. Points are colored by month. The horizontal line is at the average rank."
# make markers for months at their mid points
months <- data.frame(
  month =unique(Draft1970$Month),
  mid = seq(15, 365-15, by = 30))

ggplot2:: theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 16))
gg <- ggplot(Draft1970, aes(x = Day, y = Rank)) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5, shape = 21, 
             alpha = 0.3, 
             color = "black", 
             aes(fill=Month)
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rainbow(12)) +
  geom_text(data=months, aes(x=mid, y=0, label=month), nudge_x = 5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ 1,
              col = "black", fill="grey", linetype = "dashed", alpha=0.6) +
  labs(x = "Day of the year",
       y = "Lottery rank") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
gg
```

The ranks do seem to be essentially random.  Is there any reason to suspect
a flaw in the selection process, as I firmly hoped at the time?
  
  If you stare at the graph in @fig-draft-gg1 long enough, you can make out a sparsity of points in the
upper right corner and also the lower left corner compared to the opposite corners. 

#### Visual smoothers {.unnumbered}
Fitting a linear regression line or a smoothed (loess) curve can bring out the signal lurking in the background of a field of nearly random points. @fig-draft-gg2 shows a definite trend to lower 
ranks for birthdays toward the end of the year. Those born earlier in the
year were more likely to be given lower ranks, calling them up sooner for the draft.

```{r}
#| label: fig-draft-gg2
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| fig-cap: "Enhanced scatterplot of 1970 Draft Lottery data adding a linear regression line and loess smooth."
ggplot(Draft1970, aes(x = Day, y = Rank)) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5, shape = 21, 
             alpha = 0.3, 
             color = "black", 
             aes(fill=Month)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rainbow(12)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y~1,
              se = FALSE,
              col = "black", fill="grey", linetype = "dashed", alpha=0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y~x,
              color = "blue", se = FALSE,
              alpha=0.25) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y~x,
              color = "darkgreen",
              fill = "darkgreen", 
              alpha=0.25) +
  geom_text(data=months, aes(x=mid, y=0, label=month), nudge_x = 5) +
  labs(x = "Day of the year",
       y = "Lottery rank") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
```

Is this a real effect? 
Even though the points seem to be random over the year, linear regression of `Rank` on `Day` shows a highly significant negative effect even though the 
correlation[^rank-cor] is small ($r = -0.226$), the slope, -0.226,
means that for each additional day in the year decreases about 1/4 rank toward
the front of the draft line, nearly 7 ranks per month.

[^rank-cor]: Because both days of the year and rank in the lottery are the integers, 1 to 366,
the Pearson correlation and Spearman rank order correlation are identical.

```{r draft-mod}
draft.mod <- lm(Rank ~ Day, data=Draft1970)
with(Draft1970, cor(Day, Rank))
coef(draft.mod)
```

So, smoothing the data, using either the linear regression line or a nonparametric smoother is one important
technique for seeing a weak signal in a noisy background.

#### Statistical summaries {.unnumbered}
Another way to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of a graph is to plot summaries of the messy data points.
For example, you might make boxplots of the ranks by month, or calculate and plot the mean or median
rank by month and plot those together with some indication of variability within month.

@fig-draft-means plots the average `Rank` for each month with error bars showing the mean $\pm 1$ standard errors against the average `Day`. The message of rank decreasing nearly linearly with month is now more dramatic. The correlation between the means is $r = -0.867$.

```{r}
#| label: fig-draft-means
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
#| code-fold: show
#| fig-cap: "Plot of the average rank per month with $\\pm 1$ standard error bars. The line shows the least squares regression line, treating months as equally spaced."
means <- Draft1970 |>
  group_by(Month) |>
  summarize(Day = mean(Day),
            se = sd(Rank/ sqrt(n())),
            Rank = mean(Rank)) 

ggplot(aes(x = Day, y = Rank), data=means) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y~x,
              color = "blue", fill = "blue", alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Rank-se, ymax = Rank+se), width = 8) +
  geom_text(data=months, aes(x=mid, y=0, label=month), nudge_x = 5) +
  labs(x = "Average day of the year",
       y = "Average lottery rank")
```

The visual impression of a linearly decreasing trend in lottery rank is much stronger in @fig-draft-means
than in @fig-draft-gg2 for two reasons: 
  
* Replacing the data points with their means strengthens the signal in relation to noise.
* The narrower vertical range (100--250) in the plot of means makes the slope of the line appear steeper. (The correlation of the means, $r = -0.231$ is nearly the same as the correlation of the data points.)

#### What happened here? {.unnumbered}

Previous lotteries carried out by drawing capsules from a container had occasionally suffered the embarrassment that an empty capsule was selected 
because of vigorous mixing [@Fienberg:71]. So for the 1970 lottery, the birthdate capsules were
put in cardboard boxes, one for each month and these were carefully emptied into the glass container in order of month: Jan., Feb., ... Dec., gently shaken in atop the pile already there.  All might have been well had the persons drawing the capsules
put their hand in truly randomly, but generally they picked from toward the top of the container.
Consequently, those born later in the year had a greater chance of being picked earlier.

There was considerable criticism of this procedure once the flaw had been revealed by analyses
such as described here. In the following year, the Selective Service called upon the National
Bureau of Standards to devise a better procedure. In 1971 they used two drums, one with the
dates of the year and another with the rank numbers 1-366. As a date capsule was drawn randomly from the
first drum, another from the numbers drum was picked simultaneously, giving a doubly-randomized
sequence. 

Of course, if they had R, the entire process could have been done using `sample()`:

```{r sample}
set.seed(42)
date = seq(as.Date("1971-01-01"), as.Date("1971-12-31"), by="+1 day")
rank = sample(seq_along(date))
draft1971 <- data.frame(date, rank)

head(draft1971, 4)
tail(draft1971, 4)
```

And, what would have happened to me and all others born on a May 7th, if they did it this way?
My lottery rank would have 274!

```{r}
me <- as.Date("1971-05-07")
draft1971[draft1971$date == me,]
```
