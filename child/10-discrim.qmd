## Discriminant analysis


As described earlier (@sec-t2-discrim), discriminant analysis is similar to a one-way MANOVA, but with its emphasis
on the problem of classifying observations into groups rather than testing whether there are significant differences
of the means for the response variables. You can see this difference in the model formulas used in `lm()` compared
with `MASS::lda()`, which fits a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model.

```{r eval=FALSE}
manova.mod  <- lm(cbind(y1, y2, y3) ~ group)
discrim.mod <- MASS::lda(group ~ y1 + y2 + y3)
```

The discussion here is limited to what this altered focus adds to visualizing differences among groups on a collection
of response variables. See @Kleka1980, @Lachenbruch1975 for a basic, but more general introduction to discriminant analysis methods.

As in MANOVA, LDA assumes equal variance covariance matrices across the groups.
