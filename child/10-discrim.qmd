## Discriminant analysis


As described earlier (@sec-t2-discrim), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is similar to a one-way MANOVA, but with its emphasis
on the problem of _classifying observations_ into groups rather than _testing_ whether there are significant differences
of the means for the response variables. You would use LDA rather than MANOVA when your goal is to predict group membership and identify which variables best distinguish between pre-defined groups, rather than just testing for group differences.

LDA can be seen as a reversed MANOVA, where the role of dependent and independent variables is flipped.
You can see this difference in the model formulas used in `lm()` compared with `MASS::lda()`, which fits a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model.

```{r eval=FALSE}
manova.mod  <- lm(cbind(y1, y2, y3) ~ group)
discrim.mod <- MASS::lda(group ~ y1 + y2 + y3)
```

One consequence of this flipped emphasis is that predicted values from `predict()` for an LDA is the predicted group membership for an observation
with values $y_1, y_2, y_3$ rather than the predicted values $\hat{y}_1, \hat{y}_2, \hat{y}_3$ of those responses in MANOVA.
This is useful for classifying new observations from an LDA model, such as determining whether new Swiss banknotes are real or fake (@exm-banknote).

The discussion here is limited to what this altered focus adds to visualizing differences among groups on a collection
of response variables. See @Kleka1980, @Lachenbruch1975 for a basic, but more general introduction to discriminant analysis methods.
There is a useful discussion in this Cross Validated question 
[How is MANOVA related to LDA?](https://bit.ly/4gpMykN) {.content-visible when-format="pdf"} (https://bit.ly/4gpMykN).

As in MANOVA, LDA assumes equal variance covariance matrices across the groups. --> qda()

Another way that LDA differs from MANOVA is that for classification purposes, the relative proportions of the groups
has a role in determining the classification rules --> prior probs

**Penguins on Island Z**

For an example, imagine you are a researcher on an expedition to Antarctica to survey the penguin population. 
You stop at a small, as yet unnamed island "Z", and find three penguins you want to study, who you call
Abe, Betsy and Chloe. How can you determine their species based on what you know of the penguins studied before?

<!--
Make up some data for these three new penguins

new_peng <- tibble(
  id = c("Abe", "Betsy", "Chloe"),
  species = rep(NA, 3),
  island = rep("Z", 3),
  bill_length = c(),
  bill_depth= c(),
  flipper_length = c(),
  body_mass = c(),
  sex = c("m", "f", "f")
)
