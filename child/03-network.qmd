## Network diagrams

A major theme throughout this chapter has been to understand how to extend data visualization from
simple bivariate scatterplots to increasingly more complex situations with larger datasets.
With a moderate number of variables, techniques such as smoothing, summarizing with
data ellipses and fitted curves, and visual thinning can be used to tame "big $N$" datasets
with thousands of cases. 

However "big $p$" datasets, with more than a moderate number ($p$)
still remains a challenge. It is hard to see how the more advanced methods
(corrgrams, parallel coordinate) described earlier could cope with $p = 20, 50, 100, 500, \dots$ variables.
At some point, each of these begins to break down for the purpose of visualizing associations
among many variables. We are forced to thin the information presented in graphs
more and more as the number of variables increases.

It turns out that there is a way to increase the number of variables displayed dramatically,
if we are mainly interested in the pairwise correlations for reasonably
normally distributed data. A graphical **network diagram** portrays variables by _nodes_ (vertices),
connected by (weighted) _edges_ whose properties reflect the strength of connections between
pairs, such as a correlation. Such diagrams can reveal properties not readily seen by other means.

As an example consider @fig-big5-qgraph-rodrigues, which portrays the correlations
among 25 items from the NEO-PR-R personality questionnaire, which through factor analysis
has resulted in the "Big Five" scales of aspects of personality, mnemonically captured
by the acronym **OCEAN**: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism.

The magnitude of a correlation is shown by the thickness and transparency of the edge betwen two item nodes. The sign of a correlation is shown by edge color and style: solid blue for positive and dashed red for negative. _Source_: [Rodrigues (2021)](https://bit.ly/3A6kvq5)"
