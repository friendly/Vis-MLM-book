## Network diagrams

A major theme throughout this chapter has been to understand how to extend data visualization from
simple bivariate scatterplots to increasingly more complex situations with larger datasets.
With a moderate number of variables, techniques such as smoothing, summarizing with
data ellipses and fitted curves, and visual thinning can be used to tame "big $N$" datasets
with thousands of cases. 

However "big $p$" datasets, with more than a moderate number ($p$) of variables
still remain a challenge. It is hard to see how the more advanced methods
(corrgrams, parallel coordinate) described earlier could cope with $p = 20, 50, 100, 500, \dots$ variables.
At some point, each of these begins to break down for the purpose of visualizing associations
among many variables. We are forced to thin the information presented in graphs
more and more as the number of variables increases.

It turns out that there is a way to increase the number of variables displayed dramatically,
if we are mainly interested in the pairwise correlations for reasonably
normally distributed data. A graphical **network diagram** portrays variables by _nodes_ (vertices),
connected by (weighted) _edges_ whose properties reflect the strength of connections between
pairs, such as a correlation. Such diagrams can reveal properties not readily seen by other means.

As an example consider @fig-big5-qgraph-rodrigues, which portrays the correlations
among 25 self-report items reflecting 5 factors (the "Big Five")
considered in personality psychology to represent the dominant aspects of
all of personality. These factors are easily remembered by the acronum
**OCEAN**: **O**penness, **C**onscientiousness, **E**xtraversion, **A**greeableness and **N**euroticism.
The dataset, `psych::bfi`, contains data from an online sample of $n=2800$ with 5 items for each scale.

In this figure (taken from [Rodrigues (2021)](https://bit.ly/3A6kvq5)),
the item nodes are labeled according to the OCEAN factor they are assumed to measure.
For 25 items, there are $25 \times 24 / 2 = 300$ correlations, but here
edges are drawn _only_ between nodes where the correlation is considered significant
by a method ("glasso") designed to make the graph optimally sparse.

<!-- Actually, the psych::bfi data is:
25 personality self report items taken from the International Personality Item Pool (ipip.ori.org) were included as part of the Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment (SAPA) web based personality assessment project. The data from 2800 subjects are included here as a demonstration set for scale construction, factor analysis, and Item Response Theory analysis. Three additional demographic variables (sex, education, and age) are also included.

The edges shown in @fig-big5-qgraph-rodrigues reflect the Pearson correlation between a given pair of items by the visual attributes of color and line style: magnitude is shown by both the thickness and transparency of the edge; the sign of the correlation is shown by color and line type:
solid `r blue` for positive correlations and dashed `r red` for negative ones.

According to some theories the five personality factors should be largely non-overlapping,
so there should not be many edges connecting items of one factor with those of another.
Yet, there are quite a few cross connections in @fig-big5-qgraph-rodrigues,
so perhaps the theory is wrong, or, more likely, the 25 items are not good representatives of
these underlying dimensions.

Network diagrams stem from mathematical graph theory (refs:) of the properties
of nodes and edges used to represent pairwise relationships, ...

-> network science, network psychometrics, ...

-> packages: qgraph, ...

For the present purposes, let's see what network diagrams can tell us about the crime data
analyzed earlier.

```{r}
#| label: fig-crime-cor-code
library(qgraph)
ord <- corrMatOrder(crime.cor, order = "AOE")
rownames(crime.cor)[ord]
crime.cor <- crime.cor[ord, ord]

# "association graph": network of correlations
qgraph(crime.cor, 
  title = "Crime data:\ncorrelations", title.cex = 1.5,
  graph = "cor",
  minimum = "sig", sampleSize = nrow(crime), alpha = 0.01,
  color = grey(.9), vsize = 12,
  labels = rownames(crime.cor),
  posCol = "blue")
```
