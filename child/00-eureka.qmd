## EUREKA!

Even modest sized multivariate data can have secrets that can be revealed in the right view.
As an example, David Coleman at RCA Laboratories in Princeton, N.J. generated a dataset of
five (fictitious) measurements of grains of pollen for the 1986 Data Exposition at the
Joint statistical Meetings.
The first three variables are the lengths of geometric features 3848 observed sampled pollen grains -- in the x, y, and z dimensions: a `ridge` along x, a `nub` in the y
direction, and a `crack` in along the z dimension.  The fourth
variable is pollen grain `weight`, and the fifth is `density`.
The challenge was to "find something interesting" in this dataset, now available as `animation::pollen`.
\ixd{pollen}
\ixp{animation}

Those who solved the puzzle were able to find an orientation of this 5-dimensional dataset, such that
zooming in revealed a magic word, "EUREKA" spelled in points, as in the following figure.

Four views of the `pollen` data, zooming in, clockwise from the upper left to discover the word "EUREKA".

This can be seen better in a 3D animation. The `rgl` package [@R-rgl] is used to create a 3D scatterplot of the first three
variables. Then the `animation` package [@R-animation] is use to record a sequence of images, adjusting the
`rgl::par3d(zoom)` value.

### Multivariate scientific discoveries
Lest this example seem contrived (which it admittedly is), multivariate visualization has played an important role in quite a few scientific discoveries. Among these, Francis Galton's [-@Galton:1863] discovery of the
anti-cyclonic pattern of wind direction in relation to barometric pressure from many weather measures
recorded systematically across all weather stations, lighthouses and observatories in Europe in December 1861
stands out as the best example of a scientific discovery achieved almost entirely through graphical meansâ€“-- something that was totally unexpected, and purely the product of his use of remarkably novel high-dimensional graphs [@FriendlyWainer:2021:TOGS, p. 170-173].

A more recent example is the discovery of two general classes in the development of Type 2 diabetes by
@ReavenMiller:79, using PRIM-9 [@Fishkeller-etal:1974b], the first computer system for high-dimensional
visualization[^prim9]. In an earlier study @ReavenMiller:68 examined the relation between blood glucose
levels and the production of insulin in normal subjects and in patients with varying degrees of
hyperglicemia (elevated blood sugar level). They found a peculiar "horse shoe" pattern
They found a peculiar ``horse shoe'' shape in this relation (shown in @fig-diabetes1), about which they could only speculate: perhaps individuals with the best glucose tolerance also had the lowest levels of insulin as a response to an oral dose of glucose; perhaps those with low glucose response could secrete higher levels of insulin; perhaps those who were low on both glucose and insulin responses followed some other mechanism.
In 2D plots, this was a mystery.

[^prim9]: PRIM-9 is an acronym for **P**icturing, **R**otation, **I**solation and **M**asking in up to **9** dimensions. These operations are fundamental to interactive and dynamic data visualization.

#| label: fig-diabetes1
#| out-width: "70%"
#| code-fold: false

     cex.lab=1.25,
     xlab="Glucose response",
     ylab="Insulin response")
```

An answer to their questions came ten years later, when they were able to
visualize similar but new data in 3D using the PRIM-9 system. In a carefully
controlled study, they also measured ``steady state plasma glucose'' (SSPG), a
measure of the efficiency of use of insulin in the body, where large values mean
insulin resistance, as well as other variables. PRIM-9 allowed them to explore
various sets of three variables, and, more importantly, to rotate a given plot
in three dimensions to search for interesting features. One plot that stood out
concerned the relation between plasma glucose response, plasma insulin response
and SSPG response, shown in @fig-ReavenMiller-3d.

```

From this graphical insight, they were able to classify the participants
into three groups, based on clinical levels of glucose and insulin. The
people in the wing on the left in @fig-ReavenMiller-3d, with high levels of
fasting glucose, were considered to have overt diabetes. Those in the
right wing were classified as chemical diabetics, and those in the
central blob were classified as normal.
