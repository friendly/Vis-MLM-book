## EUREKA!

Even modest sized multivariate data can have secrets that can be revealed in the right view.
As an example, David Coleman at RCA Laboratories in Princeton, N.J. generated a dataset of
five (fictitious) measurements of grains of pollen for the 1986 Data Exposition at the
Joint statistical Meetings.
The first three variables are the lengths of geometric features 3848 observed sampled pollen grains -- in the x, y, and z dimensions: a `ridge` along x, a `nub` in the y
direction, and a `crack` in along the z dimension.  The fourth
variable is pollen grain `weight`, and the fifth is `density`.
The challenge was to "find something interesting" in this dataset.

Those who solved the puzzle were able to find an orientation of this 5-dimensional dataset, such that
zooming in revealed a magic word, "EUREKA" spelled in points, as in the following figure.

Four views of the `pollen` data, zooming in, clockwise from the upper left to discover the word "EUREKA".

This can be seen better in a 3D animation. `rgl` [@R-rgl] is used to create a 3D scatterplot of the first three
variables. Then the `animation` package [@R-animation] is use to record a sequence of images, adjusting the
`rgl::par3d(zoom)` value.

open3d(userMatrix = uM, 
       windowRect = c(10, 10, 510, 510))

plot3d(pollen[, 1:3])

# zoom in
zm = seq(1, 0.045, length = 200)
par3d(zoom = 1)
for (i in 1:length(zm)) {
  par3d(zoom = zm[i])
  ani.pause()
}
ani.options(oopt)

### Multivariate scientific discoveries
Lest this example seem contrived (which it admittedly is), multivariate visualization has played an important role in quite a few scientific discoveries. Among these, Francis Galton's [-@Galton:1863] discovery of the
anti-cyclonic pattern of wind direction in relation to barometric pressure from many weather measures
recorded systematically across all weather stations, lighthouses and observatories in Europe in December 1861
stands out as the best example of a scientific discovery achieved almost entirely through graphical meansâ€“-- something that was totally unexpected, and purely the product of his use of remarkably novel high-dimensional graphs [@FriendlyWainer:2021:TOGS, p. 170-173].

A more recent example is the discovery of two general classes in the development of Type 2 diabetes by
@ReavenMiller:79, using PRIM-9 [@Fishkeller-etal:1974b], the first computer system for high-dimensional
visualization[^prim9]. An earlier study @ReavenMiller:68 ...**TODO** ... Complete diabetes classification ....

[^prim9]: PRIM-9 is an acronym for **P**icturing, **R**otation, **I**solation and **M**asking in up to **9** dimensions.
