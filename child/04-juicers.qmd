## Multivariate Juicers

There was a cloud in the sky above _Flatland_ one day. But it was a huge, multidimensional cloud of points that might contain
some important message, perhaps like EUREKA (@fig-Eureka), or perhaps forecasting the upcoming harvest,
if only flatlanders could appreciate it. A leading citizen, A SQUARE, who had an inking of Spaceland, thought:
"Oh, can I, in my imagination, rotate that cloud and squeeze its' juice so that it rains down on Flatland with greatest joy?"
