## Linear combinations

All methods of multivariate statistics involve a simple idea: Finding weighted sums---_linear combinations_--- of
observed variables to optimize some criterion---maximizing a measure of goodness-of-fit, like $R^$ or minimizing
a measure of badness-of-fit like sums of squares of residuals. Methods differ according to whether

* All variables belong to **one set** (say, $\mathbf{X}$), not distinguished as to whether they are responses or predictors, as in PCA and factor analysis, 
vs. **two sets** where one set  is considered outcome, dependent variables, to be explained by predictors, 
independent variables ($\mathbf{X}$),
as in multiple regression, multivariate analysis of variance, discriminant analysis and canonical correlation analysis.

* The variables in $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ are discrete, **categorical factors** like sex and level of education or **quantitative** variables like salary and number of years of experience.
