## Linear combinations

All methods of multivariate statistics involve a simple idea: Finding weighted sums---_linear combinations_--- of
observed variables to optimize some criterion---maximizing a measure of goodness-of-fit, like $R^2$ or minimizing
a measure of badness-of-fit like sums of squares of residuals. Methods differ according to whether:

* All variables belong to **one set** (say, $\mathbf{X}$), not distinguished as to whether they are responses or predictors, as in PCA and factor analysis, 
vs. **two sets** where one set  is considered outcome, dependent variables, to be explained by predictors, 
independent variables ($\mathbf{X}$),
as in multiple regression, multivariate analysis of variance, discriminant analysis and canonical correlation analysis.

* The variables in $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ are discrete, **categorical factors** like sex and level of education or **quantitative** variables like salary and number of years of experience.

For example, @fig-lin-comb-pca illustrates PCA (as we saw in @sec-pca-biplot) as finding weights to maximize the variance of linear combinations, $v_1, v_2, ...$,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbf{v}_1 & = & a_1 \mathbf{x}_1 + a_2 \mathbf{x}_2 + a_3 \mathbf{x}_3 + a_4 \mathbf{x}_4 \\
\mathbf{v}_2 & = & b_1 \mathbf{x}_1 + b_2 \mathbf{x}_2 + b_3 \mathbf{x}_3 + b_4 \mathbf{x}_4 \\
\dots & \dots \; , \\
\end{eqnarray*}

subject to all $\mathbf{v}_i, \mathbf{v}_j$ being uncorrelated, $\mathbf{v}_i \;\perp\; \mathbf{v}_j$.
