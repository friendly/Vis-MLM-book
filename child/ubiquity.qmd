## Ubiquity of multivariate research designs

Multivariate response designs are increasingly common in applied behavioral and social science research, and are utilized to analyze a wide range of phenomena. For instance, as an introductory exercise, graduate students registered a multivariate data analysis course in the Psychology Department at York University between 1990 and 2015 were asked to scan one or more journals in their area and to find at least one paper that utilized some form of multivariate analysis.

With an average of 15--20 students per year and over approximately 20 years, this yielded a bibliographic database containing 405 exemplars [@py614bib]. These used a variety of multivariate and supplementary univariate methods, ranging from MANOVA to path analysis, from canonical correlation to multidimensional scaling, which were categorized by statistical method using keyword terms.

Overall, MANOVA, factor analysis, multiple regression, correlation, and principal components analysis were utilized the most frequently. See @fig-heatmap for a summary of these results, using a heatmap display of frequencies by time. An overall categorization pertaining to the type of multivariate model used (CDA = Categorical data analysis, FA = Factor analysis, GDA = Geometric data analysis, and LM = Linear models) is shown in the right margin. This is clearly not a representative sample of the literature, but it does illustrate an increase of articles deemed noteworthy over time.

Further, a content analysis of the article titles reveals the variation in topics discussed. For instance, @fig-wordcloud is a wordcloud showing the 50 most frequently-used words, with size proportional to occurrence. While a few of the terms are analytic (e.g., the most frequently used term is "analysis", with 33 occurrences), others showcase the breadth of psychological research, as personality, factor, social, memory, children, cognitive, behavior, all appear in the top 15, with 14 or more appearances each.
