## Grand Tours

In the mid 17$^th$  to early 19$^th$-century the **Grand Tour**
became a coming-of-age custom for young Europeans 
(mainly British nobility and landed gentry)
of sufficient rank and means to undertake a journey to the principal sites of Europe
(Paris, Geneva, Rome, Athens, ...) to complete their education by learning something of
the cultural legacies in history, art, music from antiquity to the Renaissance.
Thereby, they could gain a wider appreciation of history and be prepared to play
a role in polite society or in their chosen endeavors.

Travels in high-dimensional data space are understandably less thrilling than a journey
from Oxford through Paris and Turin to Rome. Yet, in both cases it is useful to
think of the path taken, and what might be seen along the way.
More importantly, we might want to plan a tour to see the most interesting 
sites in travel, or find features such as clusters, outliers or non-linear relations in data.

Following the demonstration in PRIM-9 (@sec-discoveries) of exploring multidimensional
data space by rotation @Asimov:85 developed the idea of the _grand tour_,
a computer method for viewing multivariate statistical data via orthogonal projections onto an animated
sequence of two-dimensional subspaces.
In contrast to a scatterplot matrix which shows a static view of a data cloud projected onto
all pairwise variable axes, the grad tour is like the view of an eye moving smoothly in high-dimensional
space, capturing what it sees from a given location onto the 2-d plane of the computer screen.

source("R/penguin/penguin-colors.R")
col <- peng.colors()[peng$species]
animate(peng_scaled, 
        guided_tour(lda_pp(peng$species)),
        display = display_xy(col = col,
                             cex = 1.5,
                             edges.width = 2))
```
