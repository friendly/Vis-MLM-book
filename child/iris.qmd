## Iris data


Perhaps the most famous (or infamous) dataset in the history of multivariate data analysis is that of measurements on three species of Iris flowers collected by Edgar Anderson [-@Anderson:35] in the Gaspé Peninsula of Québec, Canada. 
Anderson wanted to quantify the outward appearance ("morphology": shape, structure, color, pattern, size) of species as a method to study variation within and between such groups. Although Anderson published in the obscure _Bulletin of the American Iris Society_, R. A. Fisher [-@Fisher:1936] saw this as a challenge and opportunity to introduce the method now called
discriminant analysis -- how to find a weighted composite of variables to best discriminate among existing groups.

I said "infamous" above because Fisher published in the _Annals of Eugenics_, was an ardent eugenicist himself, 
and the work of eugenicists was often pervaded by prejudice against racial, ethnic and disabled groups.
Through guilt by association, the Iris data, having mistakenly been called "Fisher's Iris Data",
has become deprecated, even called "racist data". The voices of the _Setosa_, _Versicolor_ and _Virginica_ of
Gaspé have been silenced. @Bodmer-etal-2021 present a careful account of Fisher's views on eugenics within the context
of his time and his contributions to modern statistical theory and practice.
