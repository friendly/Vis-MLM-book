## What We Have Learned

* **Data space and $\beta$ space are dualities of each other** - While we typically visualize regression models in data space (where points are observations), there's a parallel $\beta$ space where points represent models and their coefficients. These spaces mirror each other in elegant ways: lines in one space become points in the other, and confidence ellipses in $\beta$ space are 90$^\circ$ rotations of data ellipses. This duality reveals that we gain precision in estimating coefficients precisely where our data spread the most.

* **Confidence ellipses make hypothesis testing visual and intuitive** - Instead of squinting at p-values in regression output, we can literally see whether hypotheses are supported by checking whether null hypothesis points fall inside or outside confidence ellipses. The shadows of these ellipses automatically give us individual confidence intervals, while the full ellipse captures joint uncertainty about multiple coefficients.

* **Measurement error in predictors is far more dangerous than measurement error in responses** - While errors in your response variable (y) simply inflate standard errors without biasing coefficients, errors in predictors create attenuation bias that systematically pulls slope estimates toward zero. This "errors-in-variables" problem means that unreliable measurements of your predictors can make real effects appear weaker than they actually are.

* **In multiple regression, measurement error in one predictor contaminates estimates of other predictors** - Perhaps most surprisingly, when one predictor in your model suffers from measurement error, it doesn't just bias its own coefficient---it also distorts the coefficients of other variables in unpredictable ways. This distortion will cascade, meaning that measurement quality affects your entire model, not just individual variables.

* **Ellipses reveal the hidden geometry behind familiar statistical concepts** - Data ellipses, confidence ellipses, and their mathematical relationships provide a geometric foundation for understanding correlation, regression coefficients, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests. This visual approach transforms abstract statistical concepts into concrete geometric relationships that you can literally see and manipulate.
