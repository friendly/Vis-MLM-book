## Flatland

> To comport oneself with perfect propriety in Polygonal society, one ought to be a Polygon oneself.
> --- Edwin A. Abbott, _Flatland_

In 1884, an English schoolmaster, Edwin Abbott Abbott, shook the world of Victorian culture with a 
slim volume, _Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions_ [@Abbott:1884]. He described a two-dimensional world, _Flatland_,
inhabited entirely by geometric figures in the plane. His purpose was satirical, to poke fun at the 
social and gender class system at the time:
Women were mere line segments, while men were represented as polygons with varying numbers of sides--- 
a triangle was a working man; gentlemen and professionals had more sides.
Abbot published this under the pseudonym, "A Square", suggesting his place in the hierarchy.

> True, said the Sphere; it appears to you a Plane, because you are not accustomed to light and shade and
> perspective; just as in Flatland a Hexagon would appear a Straight Line to one who has not the Art of Sight
> Recognition. But in reality it is a Solid, as you shall learn by the sense of Feeling.
> --- Edwin A. Abbott,  _Flatland_


But how did it feel to be a member of a flatland society? How could a point (a child?) understand a
line (a woman)?  How does a Triangle "see" a Hexagon or even a infinitely-sided Circle?
Abbott introduces these ideas through dreams and visions: 

* A Square dreams of visiting a one-dimensional
_Lineland_ where men appear as lines, and women are merely "illustrious points", but the inhabitants
can only see the Square as lines. 

* In another vision, the Square is visited by a Sphere, to illustrate
what a 2D flatlander could understand from a 3D sphere.

Abbott goes on to state what could be considered as a demonstration (or proof) by induction of the difficulties
of seeing in 1, 2, 3 dimensions, and how the idea motion over time (one more dimension) could 
allow citizens of any 1D, 2D, 3D world to contemplate one more dimension.

For Abbot, the way for a citizen of any world to imagine one more dimension was to consider how a
higher-dimensional object would change over time.[^1]
A line moved over time could produce a rectangle as shown in @fig-1D-4D; that rectangle moving
in another direction over time would produce a 3D figure, and so forth.

However, as far back as 1754 [@Cajori:1926],
the idea of adding a fourth dimension appears in Jean le Rond d'Alembert's "Dimensions",
and one realization of a four-dimensional object is a _tesseract_, shown in the figure below.

But wait! Where does that 4D thing (a _tesseract_) come from?
To really see a tesseract you have to view it in an animation over time:

Yet the deep mathematics of more than three dimensions only emerged in the 19th century.
In Newtonian mechanics, space and time were always considered independent of each other. 
Our familiar three-dimensional space, of length, width, and height had formed the backbone of Euclidean geometry for millenea.
However, the idea that space and time are indeed interwoven was first proposed by German mathematician Hermann Minkowski (1864--1909) in 1908. This was a powerful idea. It bore fruit when
Albert Einstein revolutionized the Newtonian conceptions of gravity in 1915 when he presented a theory of general relativity which was based primarily on the fact that mass and energy warp the fabric of four-dimensional spacetime.

The parable of _Flatland_ can provide inspiration for statistical thinking and data visualization.
Once we go beyond bivariate statistics and 2D plots, we are in a multivariate world of
possibly MANY dimensions. It takes only some imagination and suitable methods to get there.
