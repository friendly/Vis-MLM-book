## 3D scatterplots
##

3D scatterplots offer the means to visualize data with three continuous variables simultaneously.
In some cases, this may allow you to identify complex relationships, patterns, clusters, and outliers that might be missed in 2D plots. 
However, 3D plots are more difficult to construct in software and ...

By providing a spatial representation of data points in an X-Y-Z grid, they offer a comprehensive understanding of how variables interact and how changes in one affect others. Static images, if viewed from an ...
Interactivity, such as rotation, allows for viewing the data from multiple angles, further aiding insight. 

Example: 3D views of Duncan data

Code: R/Duncan/Duncan-3D.R
 * scatter3d() with data ellipse in x,z plane
 * vector-space representation with matlib::regvec3d()

Use code from `R/penguin/peng-3d-rgl.R`
