## 3D scatterplots
##

3D scatterplots offer the means to visualize data with three continuous variables simultaneously, which may allow you to
identify complex relationships, patterns, clusters, and outliers that might be missed in 2D plots. 
By providing a spatial representation of data points in an X-Y-Z grid, they offer a comprehensive understanding of how variables interact and how changes in one affect others. Static images, if viewed from an ...
Interactivity, such as rotation, allows for viewing the data from multiple angles, further aiding insight. 

Use code from `R/peng-3d-rgl.R`
