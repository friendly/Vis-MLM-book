# Visualizing Multivariate Models {#sec-vis-mlm}

Tests of multivariate models, including multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) for group differences and multivariate multiple regression (MMRA) can be easily visualized by plots of a hypothesis ("H") data ellipse for the fitted values relative to the corresponding plot of the error ellipse ("E") of the residuals, which I call the HE plot framework.

For more than a few response variables, these result can be projected onto a lower-dimensional "canonical discriminant" space providing an even simpler description.

## HE plot framework {#sec-he-framework}

@sec-Hotelling illustrated the basic ideas of the framework for visualizing multivariate
linear models in the context of a simple two group design, using Hotelling's $T^2$.  The main ideas were illustrated in @fig-HE-framework.

Having described the statistical ideas behind the MLM in @sec-mlm-review, we can proceed to
extend this framework to larger designs. @fig-dogfood-quartet illustrates these ideas using the
simple one-way MANOVA design of the dogfood data from @sec-dogfood-data.

* In data space (a), each group is summarized by its **data ellipse** (b), representing the means and covariances.

* Variation against the hypothesis of equal means can be seen by the $\mathbf{H}$ ellipse in the **HE plot** (c), representing the data ellipse of the fitted values. Error variance is shown in the $\mathbf{E}$ ellipse,
representing the pooled within-group covariance matrix, $\mathbf{S}_p$ and the data ellipse of the residuals from the model.
For the dogfood data, the group means have a negative relation: longer time to start eating is associated with a smaller amount eaten.

* The MANOVA (or Hotelling's $T^2$) is formally equivalent to a **discriminant analysis**, predicting
group membership from the response variables which can be seen in data space. (The main difference is 
emphasis and goals: MANOVA seeks to test differences among group means, while discriminant analysis aims
at classification of the observations into groups.)

* This effectively projects the $p$-dimensional
space of the predictors into the smaller **canonical space** (d) that shows the greatest differences among
the groups. As in a biplot, vectors show the relations of the response variables with the canonical dimensions.

Having described the statistical ideas behind the MLM in @sec-mlm-review, we can proceed to
extend this framework to larger designs. A conceptual overview is shown in @fig-arcmanov1 for a one-way MANOVA
design with 8 groups.

For more complex models such as MANOVA with multiple factors or multivariate multivariate regression,
there is one sum of squares and products matrix (SSP), and therefore one
$\mathbf{H}$ ellipse for each term in the model. For example, in a two-way MANOVA design with the model
formula `(y1, y2) ~ A + B + A*B` and equal sample sizes in the groups, the total sum of squares accounted for by the model is
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{SSP}_{\text{Model}} & = \mathbf{SSP}_{A} + \mathbf{SSP}_{B} + \mathbf{SSP}_{AB} \\
                            & = \mathbf{H}_A + \mathbf{H}_B + \mathbf{H}_{AB} \period
\end{align*}


## HE plot construction

The HE plot is constructed to allow a direct visualization of the "size" of hypothesized terms in
a multivariate linear model in relation to unexplained error variation.
These can be displayed in 2D or 3D plots, so I use the term "ellipsoid" below to cover all cases.

Error variation is represented by a standard 68\% data ellipsoid of the $\mat{E}$ matrix
of the residuals in $\Epsilon$. This is divided by the residual degrees of freedom, so the size of $\mat{E} / \text{df}_e$ is analogous to a mean square error
in univariate tests. The choice of 68\% coverage allows you to ``read'' the residual standard deviation as the half-length of the
shadow of the $\mat{E}$ ellipsoid on any axis (see @fig-galton-ellipse-r).
The $\mat{E}$ ellipsoid is then translated to the overall (grand) means $\bar{\mathbf{y}}$ of the variables plotted, which allows us to show the means for factor levels on the same scale, facilitating interpretation.
In the notation of @eq-ellE, the error ellipsoid is given by
$$
\mathcal{E}_c (\bar{\mathbf{y}}, \mathbf{E}) = \bar{\mathbf{y}} \; \oplus \; c\,\mathbf{E}^{1/2} \comma
$$
where $c = \sqrt{2 F_{2, n-2}^{0.68}}$ for 2D plots and $c = \sqrt{3 F_{3, n-3}^{0.68}}$ for 3D.

An ellipsoid representing variation in the means of a factor (or any other term reflected in a general linear hypothesis test, @eq-hmat) in the $\mat{H}$ matrix is simply the data ellipse of the fitted values for that term. 
Dividing the hypothesis matrix by the error degrees of freedom, giving
$\mat{H} / \text{df}_e$,
puts this on the same scale as the \E ellipse.
<!-- , as shown in the left panel of \figref{fig:heplot-iris1}. -->
I refer to this as _effect size scaling_, because it is similar to an effect size index used in
univariate models, e.g., $ES = (\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2) / s_e$ in a two-group, univariate design.

### Example: Iris data

**TODO**: Introduce the iris data earlier. Where???

@fig-iris-HE1 shows two views of the relationship between sepal length and sepal width for the iris data. ...

### Significance scaling

The geometry of ellipsoids and multivariate tests allow us to go further with another re-scaling of the $\mat{H}$ ellipsoid
that gives a _visual test of significance_ for any term in a MLM.
This is done simply by dividing $\mat{H} / df_e$ further
by the $\alpha$-critical value of the corresponding test statistic to show the strength of evidence against
the null hypothesis.
Among the various multivariate test statistics,
Roy's maximum root test, based on the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of $\mat{H} \mat{E}^{-1}$,
gives $\mat{H} / (\lambda_\alpha df_e)$
which has the visual property that the
scaled $\mat{H}$ ellipsoid will protrude _somewhere_ outside the standard $\mat{E}$ ellipsoid if and only if
Roy's test is significant at significance level $\alpha$. The critical value $\lambda_\alpha$ for Roy's
test is
$$
\lambda_\alpha = \left(\frac{\text{df}_1}{\text{df}_2}\right) \; F_{\text{df}_1, \text{df}_2}^{1-\alpha} \comma
$$
where $\text{df}_1 = \max(p, \text{df}_h)$ and $\text{df}_2 = \text{df}_h + \text{df}_e - \text{df}_1$.

For these data, the HE plot using
significance scaling is shown in the right panel of \figref{fig:heplot-iris1}.
