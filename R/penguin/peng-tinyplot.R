Which language serves as the geospatial lingua franca — #pythonor #rstats? A quick look at Google Trends suggests R, but that’s a rather simplistic comparison. Has anyone come across a more in-depth study on the most popular languages for spatial analysis?

Very interesting #ecopubs on 'Predicting interaction frequency in plant-pollinator #networks' 

'Interaction frequencies are very difficult to predict, and using traits we cannot really do better than simply using abundance information'

doi.org/10.32942/X2S...
Using the best-predicting modelling approach (randomForest), we indeed see a slight decay in predictive quality with plant and pollinator compositional distance. Temporal distance played little role, although predictions for one year ahead (or back) were better than across the season or across multiple years. The overall predictive power of our models was low (Spearman’s 𝜌 ≈ 0.4), suggesting a very noisy system. Also, the most important predictor was abundance, as revealed by a parameter-free benchmark model that only used the cross-product of abundances to predict interaction frequency. Trait and phylogenetic information did not substantially improve predictive performance beyond abundance-based predictions. Across all studies, we failed to confirm a substantial contribution of ecological characteristics to pollinator-flower interaction frequency. One reason why predictions were relatively poor is that sampling effort is not standardised, and thus networks differed substantially in the observed number of interactions, network size, and interaction density. Also the pooling of networks across space or across time may have diluted preferences in the data, reducing their explanatory value. Finally, the majority of species in each network are rare, and the interaction information they provide may be much less relevant that that of common species. At present, we conclude that the frequencies of interactions are very difficult to predict, and using traits we cannot really do better than simply using abundance information.

This International Day of Forests, I made a forest using Eucalyptus data 😀🌳

Eucalypt forests form three quarters of Australia's native forest area. They're also the tallest flowering plant in the world!

Code + hi-def 📸 👇

#rstats #dataviz 🧪📊🌏🌲
A data visualisation showing Eucalyptus observation counts and unique species, grouped by bioregion in Australia. Line length shows the number of observations, and a pale green circle sits atop each line. The size of the circle indicates the number of unique Eucalyptus species are in that bioregion. Lines and circles look like very simple, minimalist "trees" in a forest. The bioregions with the highest numbers of species are South Eastern Highlands in NSW/VIC with 214 species, followed by Sydney Basin in NSW with 198 species, followed by Mallee in WA with 161 species. Sydney Basin also had the highest number of observations.
