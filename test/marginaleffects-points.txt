# Points in plot_predictions do not seem to be correct

What are the points in `plot_predictions()`, i.e., how are they calculated?
They do not seem to be correct in the example below.

```
library(effects)  # effect plots
library(marginaleffects)
data(Prestige, package="carData")
Prestige$type <- factor(Prestige$type, levels=c("bc", "wc", "prof")) #  just reorder levels

prestige.mod2 <- lm(prestige ~ education + women +
                      log(income)*type, data=Prestige)
```

plot_predictions(prestige.mod2, condition = "education", points = .4)



For comparison, I use the effects package, and plot the partial residuals

```
predictorEffects(prestige.mod2, ~ education,
                 residuals = TRUE) |>
  plot(partial.residuals = list(pch = 16, col="blue"),
       id=list(n=4, col="black"))
```
