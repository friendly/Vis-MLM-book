Title: Word gives 'unreadable content' error when trying to open a Quarto-rendered book

I'm working on a book project in RStudio (2022.07.2 Build 576) using quarto (v. 1.1.189) and pandoc (v. 2.19.2).
I am trying to compile to `docx`.

My `_quarto.yml` file looks like this:

```
project:
  type: book

book:
  title: "Visualizing Multivariate Data and Models in R"
  author:
    - name: Michael Friendly
      url: https://datavis.ca
      affiliation: Department of Psychology<br>York University
  date: today
  cover-image: images/cover-ellipse.jpg
  favicon: images/favicon/favicon.ico
  ...

   chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - intro.qmd
    - getting_started.qmd
	...

format:
  html:
    html-math-method: mathjax
    theme: cosmo
    code-link: true
	...

  docx:
    toc: true
    toc-depth: 2
    number-sections: true
    highlight-style: github
    code-link: true
	...	
```

when I use Render Book > MS Word Format, there are no errors (except for an unresolved cross reference).
Here is what appears in the Build console

```
pandoc

```

I try to open the resulting `.docx` file, and I get the error shown in the screenshot below.

C:\R\Projects\Vis-MLM-quarto\build-problems\word-error1.png

I click `Yes` to try to recover the contents of the document, and I get a new error panel, below

C:\R\Projects\Vis-MLM-quarto\build-problems\word-error2.png

As suggested, I try to Open the file using Text Recovery, and still get the same error.
I have tried this on several machines, with the same result.

I've examined the troubleshooting guide, https://quarto.org/docs/troubleshooting/, but there is nothing that
seems relevant. In particular, I can't tell if this is a problem from Quarto or pandoc.
