# Can't run authorindex
# 

I'm trying to use the authorindex perl script on Windows 10 with a MINGW64 terminal shell. The script takes the name of the .aux input file, but relies on environmental variables BIBINPUTS and BSTINPUTS to find the references and style file for formatting an Author Index.

Described this on [TeX StackExchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/752340/running-authorindex-on-windows-mingw64-setting-bibinputs-bstinputs) and also as a [TinyTeX question](https://github.com/yihui/yihui.org/discussions/2026)
