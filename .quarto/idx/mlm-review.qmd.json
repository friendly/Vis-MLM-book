For instance, with one or more continuous predictors and multiple response variables, one could use multivariate regression to obtain estimates useful for prediction. Instead, if the predictors are categorical, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) can be applied to test for differences between groups. Again, this is akin to multiple regression and ANOVA in the univariate context -- the same underlying model is utilized, but the tests for terms in the model are multivariate ones for the collection of all response variables, rather than univariate ones for a single response.\n\nIn each of these cases, the underlying MLM is given most compactly using the matrix equation, <!-- $$ --> \n<!-- \\newcommand{\\sizedmat}[2]{\\mathord{\\mathop{\\mathbf{#1}\\limits_{(#2)}}} --> \n<!-- $$ -->\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Y}_{n \\times p} = \n\\mathbf{X}_{n \\times q} \\, \\mathbf{B}_{q \\times p} + \\mathbf{U}_{n \\times p} \\:\\: ,\n$$\n\n\\noindent where\n\n-   $\\mathbf{Y} = (\\mathbf{y}_1 , \\mathbf{y}_2, \\dots , \\mathbf{y}_p )$ is the matrix of $n$ observations on $p$ responses;\n-   $\\mathbf{X}$ is the model matrix with columns for $q$ regressors, which typically includes an initial column of 1s for the intercept;\n-   $\\mathbf{B}$ is a matrix of regression coefficients, one column for each response variable; and $\\mathbf{U}$ is a matrix of errors.\n\nThe structure of the model matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ is the same as the univariate linear model, and may contain, therefore, dummy regressors representing factors, polynomial or regression-spline terms, interaction regressors, and so on.\\[\\^2\\]\n\n## ANOVA -\\> MANOVA\n\n## MRA -\\> MMRA\n\n## ANCOVA -\\> MANCOVA\n\n## Repeated measures designs\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","html-math-method":"mathjax","output-file":"mlm-review.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.189","bibliography":["bib/references.bib","bib/R-refs.bib","bib/packages.bib","C:/Dropbox/localtexmf/bibtex/bib/graphics.bib","C:/Dropbox/localtexmf/bibtex/bib/statistics.bib"],"biblio-style":"apalike","link-citations":"no","crossref":{"chapters":true},"page-footer":"Copyright 2022, Michael Friendly","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
