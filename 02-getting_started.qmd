## Why plot your data? {#sec-why_plot}

> Getting information from a table is like extracting sunlight from a cucumber. @FarquharFarquhar:91

At the time the Farhquhar brothers wrote this pithy aphorism, graphical methods for understanding data had advanced considerably, but were not universally practiced, prompting their complaint.

The main graphic forms we use today---the pie chart, line graphs and bar---were invented by William Playfair around 1800 [@Playfair:1786; @Playfair:1801]. The scatterplot arrived shortly after [@Herschel:1833] and thematic maps showing
the spatial distributions of social variables (crime, suicides, literacy)
were used for the first time to reason about important societal questions
[@Guerry:1833] such as "is increased education associated with lower rates of crime?"

\ix{bar chart}
\ix{line graph}
\ix{scatterplot}

In the last half of the 18th Century, the idea of correlation was
developed [@Galton:1886; @Pearson:1896] and the period, roughly 1860--1890, dubbed
the "Golden Age of Graphics [@Funkhouser:1937]
became the richest period of innovation and beauty in the entire
history of data visualization. During this time there was an incredible development
of visual thinking, represented by the work of Charles Joseph Minard,
advances in the role of visualization within scientific discovery, as illustrated
through Francis Galton, and graphical excellence, embodied in state statistical
atlases produced in France and elsewhere. See @Friendly:2008:golden; @FriendlyWainer:2021:TOGS for this history.

This chapter introduces the importance of graphing data through three nearly classic stories with the following themes:

* **summary statistics are not enough**: Anscombe's Quartet demonstrates datasets that are indistinguishable
by numerical summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, correlation), but whose relationships are
vastly different.

* **one lousy point can ruin your day**: A researcher is mystified by a difference between a correlation
for men and women until she plots the data.

* **finding the signal in noise**: The story of the US 1970 Draft Lottery shows how a weak, but
reliable signal, reflecting bias in a process can be revealed by graphical enhancement
and summarization.

### Anscombe's Quartet {#sec-anscombe}

In 1973, Francis Anscombe [@Anscombe:73] famously constructed a set of four datasets
illustrate the importance of plotting the graphs before analyzing and model building, and the effect of unusual observations on fitted models.
Now known as _Anscombe's Quartet_, these datasets had identical statistical properties: the same
means, standard deviations, correlations and regression lines. 

His purpose was to debunk three notions that had been prevalent at the time:

*  Numerical calculations are exact, but graphs are coarse and limited by perception and resolution;
* For any particular kind of statistical data there is just one set of calculations constituting a correct statistical analysis;
* Performing intricate calculations is virtuous, whereas actually looking at the data is cheating.

The dataset `datasets::anscombe` has 11 observations, recorded in wide format,
with variables `x1:x4` and `y1:y4`.

```{r anscombe-data}
data(anscombe) 
head(anscombe)
```

The following code transforms this data to long format and calculates some summary statistics
for each `dataset`.


```{r anscombe-long}
anscombe_long <- anscombe |> 
  pivot_longer(everything(), 
               names_to = c(".value", "dataset"), 
               names_pattern = "(.)(.)"
  ) |>
  arrange(dataset)

anscombe_long |>
  group_by(dataset) |>
  summarise(xbar      = mean(x),
            ybar      = mean(y),
            r         = cor(x, y),
            intercept = coef(lm(y ~ x))[1],
            slope     = coef(lm(y ~ x))[2]
         )
```
As we can see, all four datasets have nearly identical univariate and bivariate statistical
measures. You can only see how they differ in graphs, which show their true natures to be vastly
different.

@fig-ch02-anscombe1 is an enhanced version of Anscombe's plot of these data, adding
helpful annotations to show visually the underlying statistical summaries.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ch02-anscombe1
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "90%"
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplots of Anscombe's Quartet. Each plot shows the fitted regression line
#|     and a 68% data ellipse representing the correlation between $x$ and $y$. "
knitr::include_graphics("figs/ch02/ch02-anscombe1.png")
```

This figure is produced as follows, using a single call to `ggplot()`, faceted by `dataset`.
As we will see later (@sec-data-ellipse), the data ellipse (produced by `stat_ellipse()`)
reflects the correlation between the variables.

```{r}
#| eval: false
desc <- tibble(
  dataset = 1:4,
  label = c("Pure error", "Lack of fit", "Outlier", "Influence")
)

ggplot(anscombe_long, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE,
              color = "red", linewidth = 1.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,20,2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,12,2)) +
  stat_ellipse(level = 0.5, color=col, type="norm") +
  geom_label(data=desc, aes(label = label), x=6, y=12) +
  facet_wrap(~dataset, labeller = label_both) 
```

The subplots are labeled with the statistical idea they reflect:

* dataset 1: **Pure error**. This is the typical case with well-behaved data. Variation of the points around the line reflect only measurement error or unreliability in the response, $y$.

* dataset 2: **Lack of fit**. The data is clearly curvilinear, and would be very well described by a quadratic, `y ~ poly(x, 2)`. This violates the assumption of linear regression that the fitted model has the correct form.

* dataset 3: **Outlier**. One point, second from the right, has a very large residual. Because this point is near the extreme of $x$, it pulls the regression line towards it, as you can see by imagining a line through the remaining points.

* dataset 4: **Influence**. All but one of the points have the same $x$ value. The one unusual point has sufficient influence to force the regression line to fit it **exactly**.

One moral from this example:

> **Linear regression only "sees" a line. It does its' best when the data are really linear. Because the line is fit by least squares, it pulls the line toward discrepant points to minimize the sum of squared residuals.**


::: {.callout-note title="Datasaurus Dozen"}

The method Anscombe used to compose his quartet is unknown, but it turns out that that there is
a method to construct a wider collection of datasets with identical statistical properties.
After all, in a bivariate dataset with $n$ observations, the correlation
has $(n-2)$ degrees of freedom, so it is possible to choose $n-2$ of the $(x, y)$
pairs to yield any given value.
As it happens, it is also possible to create any number of datasets with the same means, 
standard deviations and correlations with nearly any shape you like --- even a dinosaur!

The _Datasaurus Dozen_ was first publicized by Alberto Cairo in a [blog post](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2016/08/download-datasaurus-never-trust-summary.html)
and are available in the `r package("datasauRus", cite=TRUE)`.
As shown in @fig-datasaurus, the sets include a star, cross, circle, bullseye,
horizontal and vertical lines, and, of course the "dino".
The method [@MatejkaFitzmaurice2017] uses _simulated annealing_, an iterative process that
perturbs the points in a scatterplot, moving them towards a given shape while keeping the statistical summaries close to the fixed target value. 

The `r pkg("datasauRus")` package just contains the datasets, but
a general method, called _statistical metamers_,
for producing such datasets has been described by [Elio Campitelli](https://eliocamp.github.io/codigo-r/en/2019/01/statistical-metamerism/)
and implemented in the `r pkg("metamer")` package.

::: {.callout-note title="Quartets"}

The essential idea of a statistical "quartet" is to illustrate four quite different datasets
or circumstances that seem superficially the same, but yet are paradoxically very different
when you look behind the scenes.
For example, in the context of causal analysis @Gelman-etal:2023, illustrated
sets of four graphs, within each of which 
all four represent the same average (latent) causal effect but with
much different patterns of individual effects; @McGowan2023 provide another illustration
with four seemingly identical data sets each generated by a different causal mechanism.
As an example of machine learning models, @Biecek-etal:2023, introduced the "Rashamon Quartet",
a synthetic dataset for which four models from different classes 
(linear model, regression tree, random forest, neural network)
have practically identical predictive performance.
In all cases, the paradox is solved when
their visualization reveals the distinct ways
of understanding structure in the data.
The [**quartets**](https://r-causal.github.io/quartets/) package contains these and other variations on this theme.

## Plots for data analysis


Visualization methods take an enormous variety of forms,  but it is useful to distinguish several broad categories according to their use in data analysis:

* __data plots__ : primarily plot the raw data, often with annotations to aid interpretation (regression lines and smooths, data ellipses, marginal distributions)

* __reconnaissance plots__ : with more than a few variables, reconnaissance plots provide a high-level,
bird's-eye overview of the data, allowing you to see patterns that might not be visible in a set of separate plots. Some examples are scatterplot matrices, showing all bivariate plots of variables
in a dataset; correlation diagrams, using visual glyphs to represent the correlations between
all pairs of variables and "trellis" or faceted plots that show how a focal relation of
one or more variables differs across values of other variables.

* __model plots__ :  plot the results of a fitted model, such as a regression line or curve
to show uncertainty, or a regression surface in 3D, or a plot of coefficients in model
together with confidence intervals.
Other model plots try to take into account that 
a fitted model may involve more variables than can be shown in a static 2D plot.
Some examples of these are added variable plots, and marginal effect plots, both of which
attempt to show the net relation of two focal variables, controlling or adjusting for other variables
in a model.

* __diagnostic plots__ : indicating potential problems with the fitted model. These include residual plots, influence plots, plots for testing homogeneity of variance and so forth.

* __dimension reduction plots__ : plot representations of the data into a space of fewer dimensions than the number of variables in the dataset. Simple examples include principal components analysis (PCA) and the related biplots, and multidimensional scaling (MDS) methods.

We give some more details and a few examples in the sections that follow.


## Data plots

Data plots portray the data in a space where the coordinate axes are the observed variables.

*   1D plots include line plots, histograms and density estimates.
*   2D plots are most often scatterplots, but contour plots or hex-binned plots are also useful when the sample size is large.
<!-- *   For higher dimensions, biplots, showing the data in principal components space, together with vectors representing the correlations among variables, are often the most useful. -->


## Model plots

Model plots show the fitted or predicted values from a statistical model and provide visual summaries...

## Diagnostic plots

## Principles of graphical display

[This could be a separate chapter]

- Criteria for assessing graphs: communication goals
- Effective data display:
  + Make the data stand out
  + Make graphical comparison easy
  + Effect ordering: For variables and unordered factors, arrange them according to the
effects to be seen
- Visual thinning: As the data becomes more complex, focus more on impactful summaries
