## Introduction

I want to print quotations in color in HTML and PDF. It works in HTML but not in PDF.

## What I'm using

For HTML, my `styles.scss` includes:

```
.blockquote {
    color: #0000FF; /* Blue color */
}
```

For PDF, my `preamble.tex` includes:

```
% block quotes
\definecolor{quotecolor}{RGB}{0,0,100} % Example: blue
\renewenvironment{quote}
{%
  \list{}{\rightmargin=\leftmargin}%
  \item\relax\color{quotecolor}% <-- Apply the color here
}
{%
  \endlist
}
```
