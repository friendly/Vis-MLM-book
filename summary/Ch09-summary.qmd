## What have we learned?

This chapter introduced Hotelling's $T^2$ as the gateway to understanding multivariate analysis of variance and 
the HE plot framework for visualizing multivariate tests. Here are the essential takeaways:

* **Hotelling's $T^2$ transforms multivariate complexity into univariate clarity**. Rather than running separate $t$-tests 
on each variable (with multiple comparison problems), $T^2$ finds the single linear combination of variables that 
maximally separates the groups. This elegant approach reduces a $p$-dimensional problem to testing differences on 
one optimally-weighted composite variable.

* **The geometric interpretation reveals the statistical essence**. $T^2$ is simply the squared Mahalanobis distance 
between group means, scaled by sample size. This geometric view helps us understand why $T^2$ can detect significant 
differences even when individual variables show weak or non-significant effects ---the groups may be well-separated 
along some direction in the $p$-dimensional multivariate space.

* **HE plots provide visual hypothesis testing**. The revolutionary insight is that all information needed for multivariate
tests can be captured in two data ellipses: the $\mathbf{H}$ ellipse (representing group differences) and the $\mathbf{E}$ ellipse 
(representing within-group variation). When the $\mathbf{H}$ ellipse projects outside the $\mathbf{E}$ ellipse, the test is 
significant---making statistical significance immediately visible.

* **The discriminant axis is the line of maximum separation**. The direction connecting group means in an HE plot is 
the axis that achieves the maximum possible univariate $t^2$. This direction shows exactly 
how the variables combine to best distinguish between groups, providing both statistical power and interpretive insight.

* **Multivariate tests gain power through correlation structure**. While individual variables might show modest effects, 
the multivariate test leverages the correlations among variables to accumulate evidence. As we saw with the banknote data, 
the average univariate F was 236, but the multivariate F reached 392 by exploiting the relationships among the six size measures.

* **This framework scales directly to more complex designs**. Though we focused on two-group comparisons, the HE plot approach 
extends naturally to full MANOVA and regression designs with multiple factors and interactions. The visual principles 
remain the same: hypothesis effects as ellipses, error as ellipses, and significance determined by their relative sizes and positions.
