## What have we learned?

* **HE plots clarify complex multivariate models through direct visualization** - The HE plot framework solves the interpretability problem of multivariate models by visualizing hypothesis (H) ellipses against error (E) ellipses. Rather than navigate a confusing maze of tables of coefficients and test statistics, with HE plots you can see which effects matter, how they relate to each other, and whether they're statistically significant. All of these benefits are given in a single, intuitive plot that reveals the geometric structure underlying your multivariate analysis.

* **Visual hypothesis testing beats $p$-value hunting** - HE plots make hypothesis testing immediate and intuitive: if a hypothesis ellipse extends outside the error ellipse (under significance scaling), the effect is significant. No more scanning tables of p-values or wrestling with multiple comparisons---the geometry tells the story directly. You can even decompose overall effects into meaningful contrasts and see their individual contributions as separate ellipses.

* **Ellipse orientations reveal the hidden correlational structure of your effects** - The angles between hypothesis ellipses in HE plots directly show how different predictors relate to your response variables and to each other. When effect ellipses point in similar directions, those predictors have similar multivariate signatures; when they're orthogonal, they capture independent aspects of variation. This geometric insight goes far beyond what correlation matrices can reveal.

* **Canonical space is your secret weapon for high-dimensional visualization** - When you have many response variables, canonical discriminant analysis and canonical correlation analysis project the complex multivariate relationships into a lower-dimensional space that captures the essential patterns. This isn't just dimension reduction---it's insight amplification, revealing the fundamental directions of variation that matter most while showing how your original variables contribute to these meaningful dimensions.

* **Multivariate models become tractable through progressive visual summaries** - The chapter demonstrates a powerful visualization strategy: start with scatterplot matrices to see the raw data structure, move to HE plots to understand model effects, then project to canonical space for the clearest possible view of multivariate relationships. Each step preserves the essential information while making it more interpretable, turning the complexity of multivariate analysis into a comprehensible visual narrative.
