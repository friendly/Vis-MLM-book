## What Have We Learned?

The quest to understand equality of covariance matrices in multivariate models has taken us on a journey from Box's famous row boat metaphor to some novel visualization techniques. Here are the essential insights that will transform how you think about and explore heterogeneity in your multivariate data:

* **Visualization beats test statistics alone** - While Box's $\mathcal{M}$-test gives you a single $p$-value, covariance ellipses reveal the *why* behind heterogeneity. You can literally see differences in size (scatter) and shape (orientation) of group covariances, making the abstract concrete and interpretable.

* **Centering makes differences more apparent** - Shifting all group ellipses to a common center (the grand mean) is like removing visual noise to see the signal. This simple transformation makes differences in covariance structure apparent, turning subtle variations into obvious visual patterns.

* **Small dimensions often hold big secrets** - Don't ignore those "unimportant" principal components! The smallest PC dimensions frequently contain the most discriminating information about covariance differences. It's often where the action is hiding, away from the obvious patterns in major dimensions.

* **Multiple measures tell richer stories** - Box's $\mathcal{M}$-test uses log determinants, but why stop there? Exploring different eigenvalue functions (sum, precision, maximum) can reveal distinct patterns of heterogeneity, like having multiple lenses to examine the same phenomenon.

* **Levene meets MANOVA in beautiful harmony** - The multivariate extension of Levene's test (MANOVA on absolute deviations) creates a natural bridge between univariate and multivariate thinking, complete with interpretable HE plots that make variance differences as visual as mean differences.

<!--
* **Real data teaches better than theory** - The penguin and iris datasets show how theory comes alive: penguins with subtle but meaningful differences versus iris with dramatic covariance heterogeneity. Both teach us that the eye often sees what statistics miss.

* **Context drives interpretation** - Whether covariance equality matters depends entirely on your research goals. Sometimes "significant" heterogeneity is practically irrelevant; other times, subtle differences are scientifically crucial.

* **Graphics simplify complex concepts** - These visualization tools transform an intimidating mathematical concept (equality of $p \times p$ matrices) into something any researcher can explore, understand, and communicate to others.

The chapter's strength lies in showing that covariance matrices aren't just mathematical abstractions---they're visual stories waiting to be told, patterns waiting to be discovered, and insights illustrating the power of multivariate thinking.
