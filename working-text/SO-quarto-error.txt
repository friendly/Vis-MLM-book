# Quarto / pandoc: Can't find source of pandoc error -- pandoc.exe: Cannot decode byte '\x93'

I'm working on a book project in RStudio (2022.07.2 Build 576) using quarto (v. 1.1.189) and pandoc (v. 2.19.2).
I am compiling only to HTML.

Yesterday, rendering the book failed with the message, but without any indication where this might be.

```
pandoc.exe: Cannot decode byte '\x93': Data.Text.Internal.Encoding.decodeUtf8: Invalid UTF-8 stream
``
(This character seems to be an open 'smart quote', represented in LaTeX by "``")

I've searched for non-ascii characters in all my source files, but find none.

```
> files <- list.files(pattern = "*.qmd")
> for(f in files) {tools::showNonASCIIfile(f)}
> bibs <- list.files("bib", pattern = "*.bib")
> for(f in bibs) {tools::showNonASCIIfile(f)}
> R <- list.files("R", pattern = "*.R", full.names = TRUE)
> for(f in R) {tools::showNonASCIIfile(f)}
```

What else can I do to track down this error?  I tried commenting out all chapters except for `index.qmd` 
and get the same result.  I also tried removing nearly all the text from `index.qmd`, same.
Is it possible that quarto has written something evil in a file in `.quarto`?

mentions this, but in the context of downloading files from a website.
Another SO query, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60432489/pandoc-in-papaja-wont-decode-byte-xc6
mentions using `iconv` but I have no idea how to use this in RStudio
