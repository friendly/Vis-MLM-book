# Understanding Factor Coding and Contrast Matrices in R

## How Factor Coding Affects Linear Model Parameters

When fitting linear models in R, categorical predictors (factors) must be translated into a numerical representation that can be used in the model matrix. This process, known as "coding" or "parameterization," directly affects how we interpret the model parameters (coefficients) in the output.

The way a factor is coded determines:

1. The specific hypothesis tests that are performed
2. The interpretation of individual model coefficients
3. The reference level against which other levels are compared
4. The underlying design matrix used in the model computation

Each coding scheme represents the same model in terms of fitted values and overall significance, but they differ in how the coefficients are parameterized and interpreted. This is crucial to understand because the coefficients directly answer different research questions depending on the coding scheme used.

For a factor with k levels, we typically need k-1 parameters to represent its effect in a model. This is because with k levels, one level is used as a reference or baseline (to avoid perfect multicollinearity). The specific coding scheme determines what these k-1 parameters actually mean.

## Common Coding Schemes in R

R provides several coding schemes through the `contrasts()` function:

- `contr.treatment`: Compares each level to a reference level (default in R)
- `contr.sum`: Compares each level to the grand mean
- `contr.helmert`: Compares each level to the mean of previous levels
- `contr.poly`: For ordered factors, creates orthogonal polynomial contrasts

## Treatment Contrasts in Detail

Let's examine R's default coding scheme, `contr.treatment` (also called dummy coding), for a factor with 4 levels: a, b, c, and d.

### Treatment Contrasts in Matrix Notation

For a factor with 4 levels (a, b, c, d), where 'a' is the reference level, the contrast matrix is:

$$
\mathbf{C} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Each row represents a level of the factor (a, b, c, d), and each column represents a contrast (b-a, c-a, d-a).

In the design matrix of a linear model, this creates three dummy variables. If we denote these as $X_b$, $X_c$, and $X_d$, then:

$$
X_b = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if factor = b} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
X_c = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if factor = c} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
X_d = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if factor = d} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

### Interpretation of Coefficients

With treatment contrasts, the model coefficients have the following interpretation:

- Intercept ($\beta_0$): The mean response for the reference level 'a'
- Coefficient for level b ($\beta_b$): The difference in mean response between level 'b' and reference level 'a'
- Coefficient for level c ($\beta_c$): The difference in mean response between level 'c' and reference level 'a'
- Coefficient for level d ($\beta_d$): The difference in mean response between level 'd' and reference level 'a'

Thus, the expected response for each level is:
- Level a: $\beta_0$
- Level b: $\beta_0 + \beta_b$
- Level c: $\beta_0 + \beta_c$
- Level d: $\beta_0 + \beta_d$

### Example in R

```r
# Create a factor with 4 levels
factor_example <- factor(c("a", "b", "c", "d"))

# View the contrast matrix for this factor
contrasts(factor_example)  # By default, uses contr.treatment
```

The output would be:

```
  b c d
a 0 0 0
b 1 0 0
c 0 1 0
d 0 0 1
```

This matches our matrix representation above. Each column represents a parameter in the model, and each row shows how that parameter contributes to modeling observations from each level.

In a linear model such as `y ~ factor_example`, R will create this design matrix internally, with the first level 'a' being used as the reference level by default.

------------------------------------

MF: Can you revise the matrix expression for C to also include the column of 1s for the intercept and show how multiplying this by the symbolic vector mu <- matrix(paste0("\\mu_", letters[1:4]), 4, 1) expresses the means for the factor levels


## Treatment Contrasts in Detail

Let's examine R's default coding scheme, `contr.treatment` (also called dummy coding), for a factor with 4 levels: a, b, c, and d.

### Treatment Contrasts in Matrix Notation

For a factor with 4 levels (a, b, c, d), where 'a' is the reference level, the full design matrix including the intercept is:

$$
\mathbf{X} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The first column represents the intercept (always 1), and the remaining columns correspond to the contrasts (b-a, c-a, d-a). Each row represents a level of the factor (a, b, c, d).

If we denote the parameter vector as:

$$
\boldsymbol{\beta} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
\beta_0 \\
\beta_b \\
\beta_c \\
\beta_d
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Where $\beta_0$ is the intercept (mean of reference level 'a'), and the remaining parameters represent the differences between each level and the reference level.

In the design matrix of a linear model, this creates three dummy variables. If we denote these as $X_b$, $X_c$, and $X_d$, then:

$$
X_b = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if factor = b} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
X_c = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if factor = c} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
X_d = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if factor = d} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

### Relationship Between Contrast Matrix and Factor Level Means

To understand how the design matrix relates to the actual means of each factor level, we can use a symbolic vector of means:

$$
\boldsymbol{\mu} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
\mu_a \\
\mu_b \\
\mu_c \\
\mu_d
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Where $\mu_a$, $\mu_b$, $\mu_c$, and $\mu_d$ represent the true population means for each factor level.

The relationship between these means and the model parameters can be expressed through the design matrix:

$$
\boldsymbol{\mu} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}
$$

Which gives us:

$$
\begin{pmatrix} 
\mu_a \\
\mu_b \\
\mu_c \\
\mu_d
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 
\beta_0 \\
\beta_b \\
\beta_c \\
\beta_d
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Multiplying these matrices:

$$
\begin{pmatrix} 
\mu_a \\
\mu_b \\
\mu_c \\
\mu_d
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
\beta_0 \\
\beta_0 + \beta_b \\
\beta_0 + \beta_c \\
\beta_0 + \beta_d
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Interpretation of Coefficients

From this matrix multiplication, we can clearly see the interpretation of the coefficients:

- Intercept ($\beta_0$): The mean response for the reference level 'a' (i.e., $\mu_a = \beta_0$)
- Coefficient for level b ($\beta_b$): The difference in mean response between level 'b' and reference level 'a' (i.e., $\mu_b = \beta_0 + \beta_b$ or $\beta_b = \mu_b - \mu_a$)
- Coefficient for level c ($\beta_c$): The difference in mean response between level 'c' and reference level 'a' (i.e., $\mu_c = \beta_0 + \beta_c$ or $\beta_c = \mu_c - \mu_a$)
- Coefficient for level d ($\beta_d$): The difference in mean response between level 'd' and reference level 'a' (i.e., $\mu_d = \beta_0 + \beta_d$ or $\beta_d = \mu_d - \mu_a$)

Thus, the expected response for each level is:
- Level a: $\beta_0$
- Level b: $\beta_0 + \beta_b$
- Level c: $\beta_0 + \beta_c$
- Level d: $\beta_0 + \beta_d$

### Example in R

Let's see how this works in R:

```r
# Create a factor with 4 levels
factor_example <- factor(c("a", "b", "c", "d"))

# View the contrast matrix for this factor
contrasts(factor_example)  # By default, uses contr.treatment
```

The output would be:

```
  b c d
a 0 0 0
b 1 0 0
c 0 1 0
d 0 0 1
```

This matches the non-intercept portion of our design matrix. Each column represents a parameter in the model, and each row shows how that parameter contributes to modeling observations from each level.

Now, let's demonstrate how the design matrix relates to the factor level means:

```r
# Define the symbolic means vector
mu <- matrix(paste0("\\mu_", letters[1:4]), 4, 1)

# Create the full design matrix (including intercept)
X <- cbind(1, diag(3)[c(0, 1:3) + 1, ])

# Display the design matrix
X
```

This would output:
```
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    0    0    0
[2,]    1    1    0    0
[3,]    1    0    1    0
[4,]    1    0    0    1
```

Now we can symbolically express the relationship:

```r
# Define the symbolic parameter vector
beta <- matrix(c("\\beta_0", "\\beta_b", "\\beta_c", "\\beta_d"), 4, 1)

# Show that X * beta = mu
X %*% beta
```

This would yield the symbolic representation:
```
     [,1]
[1,] "\\beta_0"
[2,] "\\beta_0 + \\beta_b"
[3,] "\\beta_0 + \\beta_c"
[4,] "\\beta_0 + \\beta_d"
```

Which matches our mathematical expression for the factor level means in terms of the model parameters.

In a linear model such as `y ~ factor_example`, R will create this design matrix internally, with the first level 'a' being used as the reference level by default. The estimated coefficients directly correspond to our ? parameters.

-------------------------------

MF: Can you now do an example in R showing how this works for Helmert contrasts

## Helmert Contrasts

Helmert contrasts provide an alternative way to parameterize categorical factors. Unlike treatment contrasts which compare each level to a reference level, Helmert contrasts compare each level with the mean of the previous levels.

### Helmert Contrasts in Matrix Notation

For a factor with 4 levels (a, b, c, d), the Helmert contrast matrix is:

$$
\mathbf{C}_{Helmert} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
-1 & -1 & -1 \\
1 & -1 & -1 \\
0 & 2 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
$$

This is typically scaled for easier interpretation:

$$
\mathbf{C}_{Helmert\,scaled} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
-1 & -1/2 & -1/3 \\
1 & -1/2 & -1/3 \\
0 & 1 & -1/3 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

With the intercept included, the full design matrix becomes:

$$
\mathbf{X}_{Helmert} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & -1 & -1/2 & -1/3 \\
1 & 1 & -1/2 & -1/3 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & -1/3 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Interpretation of Helmert Contrasts

With Helmert contrasts, the model coefficients have the following interpretation:

- Intercept ($\beta_0$): The grand mean across all factor levels
- Coefficient 1 ($\beta_1$): The difference between level 'b' and level 'a'
- Coefficient 2 ($\beta_2$): The difference between level 'c' and the mean of levels 'a' and 'b'
- Coefficient 3 ($\beta_3$): The difference between level 'd' and the mean of levels 'a', 'b', and 'c'

### Example in R with Helmert Contrasts

Let's demonstrate Helmert contrasts in R:

```r
# Create a factor with 4 levels
factor_example <- factor(c("a", "b", "c", "d"))

# Set contrasts to Helmert
contrasts(factor_example) <- contr.helmert(4)

# View the contrast matrix
contrasts(factor_example)
```

The output would be:

```
  [,1] [,2] [,3]
a   -1   -1   -1
b    1   -1   -1
c    0    2   -1
d    0    0    3
```

Now, let's demonstrate how the design matrix relates to the factor level means:

```r
# Define the symbolic means vector
mu <- matrix(paste0("\\mu_", letters[1:4]), 4, 1)

# Create the Helmert design matrix (including intercept)
X_helmert <- cbind(1, contr.helmert(4))

# Display the design matrix
X_helmert
```

This would output:
```
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1   -1   -1   -1
[2,]    1    1   -1   -1
[3,]    1    0    2   -1
[4,]    1    0    0    3
```

### Relationship Between Helmert Contrasts and Factor Level Means

If we denote the parameter vector as:

$$
\boldsymbol{\beta}_{Helmert} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
\beta_0 \\
\beta_1 \\
\beta_2 \\
\beta_3
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Then the relationship to the means is:

$$
\begin{pmatrix} 
\mu_a \\
\mu_b \\
\mu_c \\
\mu_d
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & -1 & -1 & -1 \\
1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\
1 & 0 & 2 & -1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 
\beta_0 \\
\beta_1 \\
\beta_2 \\
\beta_3
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Let's verify this in R:

```r
# Define the symbolic parameter vector for Helmert contrasts
beta_helmert <- matrix(c("\\beta_0", "\\beta_1", "\\beta_2", "\\beta_3"), 4, 1)

# Symbolic multiplication
result <- rep("", 4)
for(i in 1:4) {
  terms <- c()
  for(j in 1:4) {
    if(X_helmert[i,j] != 0) {
      term <- ifelse(X_helmert[i,j] == 1, 
                    paste0(beta_helmert[j]), 
                    paste0(X_helmert[i,j], "*", beta_helmert[j]))
      terms <- c(terms, term)
    }
  }
  result[i] <- paste(terms, collapse=" + ")
}

# Display the symbolic representation
data.frame(Level = c("a", "b", "c", "d"), 
           Mean = c("?_a", "?_b", "?_c", "?_d"), 
           Expression = result)
```

This would yield:

```
  Level Mean                   Expression
1     a  ?_a     ?0 - ?1 - ?2 - ?3
2     b  ?_b     ?0 + ?1 - ?2 - ?3
3     c  ?_c     ?0 + 2*?2 - ?3
4     d  ?_d     ?0 + 3*?3
```

From this, we can solve for the coefficients in terms of means:

- $\beta_0 = (\mu_a + \mu_b + \mu_c + \mu_d)/4$ (Grand mean)
- $\beta_1 = (\mu_b - \mu_a)/2$
- $\beta_2 = (\mu_c - (\mu_a + \mu_b)/2)/3$
- $\beta_3 = (\mu_d - (\mu_a + \mu_b + \mu_c)/3)/4$

### Scaled Helmert Contrasts

R actually uses a scaled version of Helmert contrasts by default, which makes interpretation more straightforward:

```r
# Get the scaled Helmert contrasts that R uses by default
scaled_helmert <- contr.helmert(4, contrasts = TRUE)
scaled_helmert
```

The scaled contrasts make it easier to interpret the parameters directly as differences between a level and the mean of previous levels.

------------------------------

MF: Can you create a matrix expression to show the contrast matrices, C{treat}, C{sum}, and C_{Helmert} to show the result of contrast.treatment(4), contrast.sum(4) and contrast.Helmert(4) side by side


# Comparison of Contrast Matrices in R

## Treatment, Sum, and Helmert Contrasts Side by Side

For a factor with 4 levels (a, b, c, d), the three most common contrast matrices are:

### Contrast Matrices Without Intercept

$$
\mathbf{C}_{treat} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\quad
\mathbf{C}_{sum} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
-1 & -1 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
\quad
\mathbf{C}_{Helmert} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
-1 & -1 & -1 \\
1 & -1 & -1 \\
0 & 2 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
$$

These matrices correspond to the R functions `contr.treatment(4)`, `contr.sum(4)`, and `contr.helmert(4)` respectively.

### Full Design Matrices with Intercept

When we include the intercept column, the full design matrices become:

$$
\mathbf{X}_{treat} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\quad
\mathbf{X}_{sum} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & -1 & -1 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
\quad
\mathbf{X}_{Helmert} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & -1 & -1 & -1 \\
1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\
1 & 0 & 2 & -1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## R Code for Direct Comparison

```r
# Generate and compare contrast matrices
treatment <- contr.treatment(4)
sum_contrast <- contr.sum(4)
helmert <- contr.helmert(4)

# Display the contrast matrices
cat("Treatment Contrasts (contr.treatment):\n")
print(treatment)
cat("\nSum Contrasts (contr.sum):\n")
print(sum_contrast)
cat("\nHelmert Contrasts (contr.helmert):\n")
print(helmert)

# Create full design matrices (with intercept)
X_treat <- cbind(1, treatment)
X_sum <- cbind(1, sum_contrast)
X_helmert <- cbind(1, helmert)

# Create example data
set.seed(123)
y <- c(5, 7, 9, 12)  # Example means for levels a, b, c, d

# Fit models with different contrasts
factor_treat <- factor(c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
factor_sum <- factor(c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
factor_helmert <- factor(c("a", "b", "c", "d"))

# Set contrasts for each factor
contrasts(factor_treat) <- contr.treatment(4)
contrasts(factor_sum) <- contr.sum(4)
contrasts(factor_helmert) <- contr.helmert(4)

# Create data frame with one observation per level
data <- data.frame(
  y = y,
  treat = factor_treat,
  sum = factor_sum,
  helmert = factor_helmert
)

# Fit models using each contrast
model_treat <- lm(y ~ treat, data = data)
model_sum <- lm(y ~ sum, data = data)
model_helmert <- lm(y ~ helmert, data = data)

# Compare coefficients
cat("\nTreatment Contrast Coefficients:\n")
print(coef(model_treat))
cat("\nSum Contrast Coefficients:\n")
print(coef(model_sum))
cat("\nHelmert Contrast Coefficients:\n")
print(coef(model_helmert))

# Verify that all models produce the same fitted values
cat("\nFitted values (should be identical for all models):\n")
cbind(
  Original = y,
  Treatment = fitted(model_treat),
  Sum = fitted(model_sum),
  Helmert = fitted(model_helmert)
)
```

## Interpretation of Coefficients

The key difference between these contrasts is in how the coefficients are interpreted:

### 1. Treatment Contrasts

- **Intercept ($\beta_0$):** Mean of reference level 'a'
- **Coefficients:** Differences from reference level
  - $\beta_1 = \mu_b - \mu_a$
  - $\beta_2 = \mu_c - \mu_a$
  - $\beta_3 = \mu_d - \mu_a$

### 2. Sum Contrasts

- **Intercept ($\beta_0$):** Grand mean across all levels
- **Coefficients:** Deviations from the grand mean
  - $\beta_1 = \mu_a - \bar{\mu}$
  - $\beta_2 = \mu_b - \bar{\mu}$
  - $\beta_3 = \mu_c - \bar{\mu}$
  - (and $\mu_d - \bar{\mu} = -(\beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3)$)

### 3. Helmert Contrasts

- **Intercept ($\beta_0$):** Grand mean across all levels
- **Coefficients:** Compare each level to mean of previous levels
  - $\beta_1$ relates to $\mu_b - \mu_a$
  - $\beta_2$ relates to $\mu_c - \frac{\mu_a + \mu_b}{2}$
  - $\beta_3$ relates to $\mu_d - \frac{\mu_a + \mu_b + \mu_c}{3}$

## Relationship with Mean Values

For all three contrast types, we can express the relationship between the parameter vector $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and the means vector $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ as:

$$\boldsymbol{\mu} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}$$

This means each factor level mean can be expressed as a linear combination of the model parameters, but the specific formula differs based on the contrast type.

When using the symbolic vector of means $\boldsymbol{\mu} = (\mu_a, \mu_b, \mu_c, \mu_d)^\top$, we get:

### For Treatment Contrasts:
$$\mu_a = \beta_0$$
$$\mu_b = \beta_0 + \beta_1$$
$$\mu_c = \beta_0 + \beta_2$$
$$\mu_d = \beta_0 + \beta_3$$

### For Sum Contrasts:
$$\mu_a = \beta_0 + \beta_1$$
$$\mu_b = \beta_0 + \beta_2$$
$$\mu_c = \beta_0 + \beta_3$$
$$\mu_d = \beta_0 - \beta_1 - \beta_2 - \beta_3$$

### For Helmert Contrasts:
$$\mu_a = \beta_0 - \beta_1 - \beta_2 - \beta_3$$
$$\mu_b = \beta_0 + \beta_1 - \beta_2 - \beta_3$$
$$\mu_c = \beta_0 + 2\beta_2 - \beta_3$$
$$\mu_d = \beta_0 + 3\beta_3$$
