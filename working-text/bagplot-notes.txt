Wikipedia:
The bagplot consists of three nested polygons, called the "bag", the "fence", and the "loop".

* The inner polygon, called the bag, is constructed on the basis of Tukey depth, the smallest number of observations that can be contained by a half-plane that also contains a given point.[4] It contains at most 50% of the data points
* The outermost of the three polygons, called the fence is not drawn as part of the bagplot, but is used to construct it. It is formed by inflating the bag by a certain factor (usually 3). Observations outside the fence are flagged as outliers.[5]
* The observations that are not marked as outliers are surrounded by a loop, the convex hull of the observations within the fence.

Rousseuw et al
We propose the bagplot, a bivariate generalization of the
univariate boxplot. The key notion is the halfspace location
depth of a point relative to a bivariate dataset, which extends
the univariate concept of rank. The “depth median” is the
deepest location, and it is surrounded by a “bag” containing
the n/2 observations with largest depth. Magnifying the
bag by a factor 3 yields the “fence” (which is not plotted).
Observations between the bag and the fence are marked by
a light gray loop, whereas observations outside the fence
are flagged as outliers. The bagplot visualizes the location,
spread, correlation, skewness, and tails of the data.
