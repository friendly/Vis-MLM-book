## A Brief History of Discriminant Analysis

Discriminant analysis began with Ronald Fisher's landmark 1936 paper, where 
he introduced linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a method for 
classifying observations into predefined groups. Fisher developed this technique 
while working on a practical problem: distinguishing between species of iris 
flowers based on their physical measurements. His approach was elegant—finding 
the linear combination of variables that best separated the groups 
while minimizing within-group variation. This work laid the foundation for 
classification methods that would become central to statistics and machine 
learning [@Fisher1936].

C. R. Rao extended Fisher's framework in 1948 by introducing what would 
become known as quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). Rao relaxed Fisher's 
assumption that all groups share the same covariance structure, allowing each group to have its own covariance matrix. This generalization led to quadratic, rather than linear, decision boundaries, providing greater flexibility in modeling how groups differ [@Rao1948]. Rao's contribution was part of a broader development of multivariate statistical methods in the mid-20th century, as researchers increasingly encountered data with multiple correlated measurements.

The field evolved considerably in subsequent decades. McLachlan's comprehensive work in the 1990s unified and extended classical discriminant analysis, incorporating robust methods and providing thorough treatment of practical issues [@McLachlan2004]. More recently, Bayesian approaches have brought new perspectives to discriminant analysis, treating group membership probabilities and model parameters as uncertain quantities to be estimated from data. These methods naturally incorporate prior information and provide full posterior distributions rather than point estimates, offering richer uncertainty quantification [@Hastie2009]. Modern implementations often blend classical discriminant analysis with machine learning techniques, creating hybrid approaches that leverage the interpretability of traditional methods with the flexibility of contemporary algorithms.
