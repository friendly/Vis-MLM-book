# Testing linearity

Use the Ramsey Regression Equation Specification Error Test (RESET) to detect specification errors in the model. It was also created in 1968 by a UW-Madison student for his dissertation! The RESET performs a nested model comparison with the current model and the current model plus some polynomial terms, and then returns the result of an F-test. The idea is, if the added non-linear terms explain variance in the outcome, then there is a specification error of some kind, such as the failure to include some curvilinear term or the use of a general linear model where a generalized linear model should have been used.
