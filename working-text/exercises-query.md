# Excercises for the book

I'm writing a book titled "Visualizing Multivariate Data and Models in R" and would like you to construct a set
of exercises in R for each chapter. I will give you a link to the HTML version of a chapter and would like you
to read it and then suggest exercises for that chapter.

Exercises can be of different types:

* Extend a kind of plot shown in the chapter to do something else or different.

* Apply a method from the chapter to a new dataset. There are many datasets in the
`heplots` package, https://friendly.github.io/heplots/, the
`candisc` package, https://friendly.github.io/candisc/

The book is being written in Quarto. Each exercise should  be formatted as a `:::` div with
a tag starting `exr-` Use a level-two (##) header `## Excercises` at the start of your reply
You can include an R code chunk in the exercise.

::: {#exr-hotel1}
This is the exercise
:::

Include a solution for each exercise formatted similarly, but using the `sol-` tag, for example

::: {#sol-hotel1}
This is the solution
:::


Let's start with Chapter 3, Plots of Multivariate data. Read the chapter at:
