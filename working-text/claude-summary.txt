I would like you to read a draft of a book chapter on dimension reduction methods for multivariate data analysis, 
here: https://friendly.github.io/Vis-MLM-book/04-pca-biplot.html 
Then, please write a short chapter summary, titled "What we have learned", which gives, say 5-8 bullet points 
summarizing the essential take-away points from this chapter. Try to use an engaging style, to attract the reader
