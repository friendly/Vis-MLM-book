I am writing about analyses of the Palmer Penguin data set and need a fanciful image of a collection of
penguins on a snow covered island.
There should be three groups of penguins, representing Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo species.
There are two penguins who are outliers in my analyses -- one with a very long, straight bill, who I called Cyrano,
and the other with a shorter, very curved bill, I called Hook Nose.
Include in the image toward the front slightly larger penguins representing Cyrano and Hook Nose.
