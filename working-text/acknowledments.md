## Acknowledgments

I am profoundly grateful to my friends and colleagues John Fox, Georges Monette and Phil Chalmers
at York University who have inspired me with their insights into statistical thinking and
visualization of statistical ideas over many years. They also contributed greatly to the R
packages that help make the methods of this book accessible and easy to use.

There is also a host of graduate students I have taught, supervised and worked with over my 50+ year
career. Among these, Ernest Kwan and Matthew Sigal were important contributors to the development of
data visualization ideas and techniques reflected here. Agnieska Kopinska, Gigi Luk and Touraj Amiri
were TAs and RAs who contributed to my teaching and research. Most recently, Udi Alter and Michael Truong
helped me in numerous ways with work on this book.
