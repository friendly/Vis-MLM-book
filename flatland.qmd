## Flatland

> To comport oneself with perfect propriety in Polygonal society, one ought to be a Polygon oneself.
> --- Edwin A. Abbott, _Flatland_

In 1884, an English schoolmaster, Edwin Abbott Abbott, shook the world of Victorian culture with a 
slim volume, _Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions_ [@Abbott:1884]. He described a two-dimensional world, _Flatland_,
inhabited entirely by geometric figures in the plane. His purpose was satirical, to poke fun at the 
social and gender class system at the time:
Women were mere line segments, while men were represented as polygons with varying numbers of sides--- 
a triangle was a working man; gentlemen and professionals had more sides.
Abbot published this under the pseudonym, "A Square", suggesting his place in the hierarchy.

> True, said the Sphere; it appears to you a Plane, because you are not accustomed to light and shade and
> perspective; just as in Flatland a Hexagon would appear a Straight Line to one who has not the Art of Sight
> Recognition. But in reality it is a Solid, as you shall learn by the sense of Feeling.
> --- Edwin A. Abbott,  _Flatland_


But how did it feel to be a member of a flatland society? How could a point (a child?) understand a
line (a woman)?  How does a Triangle "see" a Hexagon or even a infinitely-sided Circle?
Abbott introduces these ideas through dreams and visions: 

* A Square dreams of visiting a one-dimensional
_Lineland_ where men appear as lines, and women are merely "illustrious points", but the inhabitants
can only see the Square as lines. 

* In another vision, the Square is visited by a Sphere, to illustrate
what a 2D flatlander could understand from a 3D sphere.

Abbott goes on to state what could be considered as a demonstration (or proof) by induction of the difficulties
of seeing in 1, 2, 3 dimensions, and how the idea motion over time (one more dimension) could 
allow citizens of any 1D, 2D, 3D world to contemplate one more dimension.

For Abbot, the way for a citizen of any world to image one more dimension was to consider how a
higher-dimensional object would change over time. However, as far back as 1754 [@Cajori:1926],
the idea of adding a fourth dimension appears in Jean le Rond d'Alembert's "Dimensions",
and one realization of a four-dimensional object is a _tesseract_, shown in the figure below.
