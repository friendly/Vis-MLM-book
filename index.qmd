## What I assume
I assume the reader to have at least a basic familiarity with R.
While R fundamentals are outside the scope of the current paper, I believe that this language provides a rich set of resources, far beyond that offered by other statistical software packages, and is well worth learning.

For those not familiar with R, I recommend @Matloff2011, @Wickham2014, and @Cotton2013 for introductions to programming in the language, and @FoxWeisberg:2018 and @Teetor2011 for learning about how to conduct basic statistical analyses.
