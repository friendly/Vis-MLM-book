# PCA and Biplots {#sec-pca-biplot}

## _Flatland_ and _Spaceland_ {#sec-spaceland}

There was a cloud in the sky above _Flatland_ one day. But it was a huge, multidimensional cloud of sparkly points that might contain some important message, perhaps like the hidden EUREKA (@fig-pollen-eureka-fig), and perhaps forecasting the upcoming harvest,
if only Flatlanders could appreciate it. 

A leading citizen, A SQUARE, who had traveled once to 
Spaceland and therefore had an inkling of its majesty beyond the simple world of his life in the plane looked at that cloud and had a brilliant thought, an OMG moment:

> "Oh, can I, in my imagination, rotate that cloud and squeeze its' juice so that it rains down on Flatland with greatest joy?"

As it happened, our Square friend, although he could never really _see_ in three dimensions could now 
at least _think_ of a world described by **height** as well as breadth and width. 

And what a world it was, inhabited by
Pryamids, Cubes and wondrous creatures called Polyhedrons with many $C$orners, $F$aces and $E$dges.
Not only that, but all those Polyhedrons were forced in Spaceland to obey a magic formula:
$C + F - E = 2$.[^1-euler]

[^1-euler]: This is Euler's formula ...

Indeed, even exalted Spheres,
having so many faces that its surface became as smooth as a baby's bottom with no need for pointed corners or edges, just as Circles were the smoothest occupants of his world.

He also marveled at Ellipsoids, as smooth as Spheres, but in Spaceland having three natural axes of different extent
and capable of being appearing fatter or slimmer when rotated from different views. An Ellipsoid
had magical properties: it could appear as so thin in one or more dimensions that it became a simple
2D ellipse, or a 1D line, or even a 0D point [@Friendly-etal:ellipses:2013].
<!-- **TODO**: somehow mention the `gellipsoid` package here. -->

All of these now arose in Square's richer 3D imagination. 
And, all of this came from just one more dimension than his life in Flatland.


### Multivariate juicers

Up to now, we have also been living in Flatland. We have been trying to understand data in
**data space** of possibly many dimensions, but confined to the 2D plane of a graph window.
Scatterplot matrices and parallel coordinate plots provided some relief. 
The former did so by **projecting** the data into sets of 2D views in the coordinates of data
space; the latter did so by providing multiple axes in a 2D space along which we could trace
the paths of individual observations.

This chapter is about seeing data in a different space, a low-dimensional, usually 2D, space
that which squeezes out the most juice
from multidimensional data for a particular purpose (@fig-MV-juicer), where what we want to
understand can be more easily seen.

Here, I concentrate on **principal components analysis** (PCA), whose goal reflects A Square's desire to see that sparkly cloud of points 
in $nD$ space in the plane showing the greatest variation among all other possible views.

This appealed to his sense of geometry, but left him wondering how the variables in that 
high-D cloud were related to the dimensions he could see in a best-fitting plane.
The idea of a **biplot**, showing the data points in the plane, together with thick pointed
arrows---variable vectors--- in one view is the other topic explained in this chapter.

## Principal components analysis {#sec-pca}

When Francis Galton [-@Galton:1886] first discovered the idea of regression toward the mean
and presented his famous diagram (@fig-galton-corr), he had little thought that he had provided a
window to a higher-dimensional world, beyond what even A Square could imagine. 
His friend, Karl Pearson [-@Pearson:1896] took that idea and developed it into a theory of
regression and a measure of correlation that would bear his name, Pearson's $r$.

But then Pearson [-@Pearson:1901] had a further inspiration, akin to that of A Square. 
If he also had a cloud of sparkly points in $2, 3, 4, ..., p$ dimensions, could he find a
point ($0D$), or line ($1D$), or plane ($2D$), or even a hyperplane ($nD$) that best summarized ---
squeezed out the most juice---from multivariate data? This was the first trully multivariate
problem in the history of statistics [@FriendlyWainer:2021:TOGS, p. 186].

The best $0D$ point was easy--- it was simply the centroid, the means of each of the
variables in the data, $(\bar{x}_1, \bar{x}_2, ..., \bar{x}_p)$, because that was "closest"
to the data in the sense of minimizing the sum of squared differences, $\Sigma_i\Sigma_j (x_{ij} - \bar{x}_j)^2$.
In higher dimensions, his solution was also an application of the method of least squares, but he argued
it geometrically and visually as shown in @fig-Pearson1901.

```{r}
#| label: fig-Pearson1901
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "70%"
#| fig-cap: "Karl Pearson's (1901) geometric, visual argument for finding the line or plane of closest fit to a collection of points, P1, P2, P3, ... "
knitr::include_graphics("images/Pearson1901.png")
```

For a $1D$ summary, the line of best fit to the points $P_1, P_2, \dots P_n$ is the line that goes through the
centroid and made the average squared length of the _perpendicular_ segments from those points to a line as small
as possible. This was different from the case in linear regression, for fitting $y$ from $x$,
where the average squared length of the _vertical_ segments, $\Sigma_i (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$ was minimized by
least squares.

He went on to prove the visual insights from simple smoothing of @Galton:1886 (shown in @fig-galton-corr) 
regarding the regression lines of
`y ~ x` and `x ~ y`. More importantly, he proved that the cloud of points is captured,
for the purpose of finding a best line, plane or hyperplane, by
the ellipsoid that encloses it, as seen in his diagram, @fig-Pearson1901-2. The major axis of the 
2D ellipse is the line of best fit, along which the data points have the smallest average squared
distance from the line. The axis at right angles to that---the minor axis--- is labeled "line of worst fit"
with the largest average squared distance.

```{r}
#| label: fig-Pearson1901-2
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "80%"
#| fig-cap: "Karl Pearson's diagram showing the elliptical geometry of regression and principal components analysis ... _Source_: Pearson (1901), p. 566."
knitr::include_graphics("images/Pearson1901_2.png")
```

Even more importantly--- and this is the basis for what we call **principal components analysis** (PCA)--- he recognized that the two orthogonal axes of the ellipse gave new coordinates for the data which were uncorrelated, whatever the correlation of $x$ and $y$.

> Physically, the axes of the correlation type-ellipse are the directions of independent and uncorrelated variation. --- @Pearson:1901, p. 566.

It was but a small step to recognize that for two variables, $x$ and $y$:

* the line of best fit, the major axis (PC1) had the greatest variance of points projected onto it;
* the line of worst fit, the minor axis (PC2), had the least variance;
* these could be seen as a rotation of the data space of $(x, y)$ to a new space (PC1, PC2) with uncorrelated variables;
* the total variation of the points in data space, $\text{Var}(x) + \text{Var}(y)$, being unchanged by rotation, was equally well expressed as the total variation $\text{Var}(PC1) + \text{Var}(PC2)$ of the scores on what are
now called the principal component axes.



### PCA by springs

Before delving into the mathematics of PCA, it is useful to see how Pearson's problem, and fitting by least squares generally, could be solved in a physical realization. 

From elementary statistics, you may be familiar with a
physical demonstration that the mean, $\bar{x}$, of a sample is the value for which the sum of deviations,
$\Sigma_i (x_i - \bar{x})$ is zero, so the mean can be visualized as the point of balance on a line where
those differnces $(x_i - \bar{x})$ are placed. Equally well, there is a physical realization of the mean
as the point along an axis where weights connected by springs will minimize the sum of squared differences,
because springs with a constant stiffness, $k$, exert forces proportional to $k (x_i - \bar{x}) ^2$. ...

Animation of PCA fitted by springs. The blue data points are connected to their projections on the red line by springs, constrained to be perpendicular to that line. From an initial position, the springs pull that line in proportion to their squared distances, until the line finally settles down to the position where the forces are balanced and the minimum is achieved.
