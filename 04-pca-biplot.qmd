## _Flatland_ and _Spaceland_ {#sec-spaceland}

There was a cloud in the sky above _Flatland_ one day. But it was a huge, multidimensional cloud of sparkly points that might contain some important message, perhaps like the hidden EUREKA (@fig-Eureka), and perhaps forecasting the upcoming harvest,
if only Flatlanders could appreciate it. A leading citizen, A SQUARE, who had traveled once to 
Spaceland and therefore had an inkling of its majesty beyond the simple world of his life in the plane
thought:

> "Oh, can I, in my imagination, rotate that cloud and squeeze its' juice so that it rains down on Flatland with greatest joy?"

As it happened, our Square friend, although he could never really _see_ in three dimensions could now 
at least _think_ of a world described by height as well as breadth and width, inhabited by
Pryamids, Cubes and wondrous creatures called Polyhedrons with many corners, sides and faces. Indeed, even Spheres,
having so many faces that its surface became as smooth as a baby's bottom, just as Circles were the smoothest occupants of his world;
he also marveled at Ellipsoids, as smooth as Spheres, but having three natural axes of different extent
and capable of being rotated to be fatter or slimmer from different views.
All of these now arose in his richer 3D imagination. 
And all of this came from just one more dimension than life in Flatland.

Up to now, we have also been living in Flatland. We have been trying to understand data in
**data space** of possibly many dimensions, but confined to the 2D plane of a graph window.
Scatterplot matrices and parallel coordinate plots provided some relief ...
