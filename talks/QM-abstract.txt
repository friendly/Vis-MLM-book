Title: Visualizing Multivariate Data & Models with R: A preview

Abstract:
I've been working on a new book, _Visualizing Multivariate Data & Models with R_!
In this talk, I'll share some of the orientation, principles and examples from the book:
(a) Data plots, model plots, diagnostic plots
(b) Plots for multivatriate data: pairs and generalized pairs plots; parallel coordinate plots; animated tours
(c) Plots for multivariate linear models: HE plots, canonical discriminant plots
(d) Visualizing equality of covariances, multivariate influence
