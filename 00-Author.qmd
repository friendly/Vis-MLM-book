[Michael Friendly](https://datavis.ca) is a 
Fellow of the American Statistical Association, Professor of Psychology and coordinator of the 
[Statistical Consulting Service](https://www.yorku.ca/research/scs/) at York University, He is an associate editor of the _Journal of Graphical and Computational Statistics_ and has served as an editorial collaborator for many other journals.
He received his Ph.D. in psychometrics and cognitive psychology from Princeton University. 

His current research work includes the development of graphical methods for data visualization, where he is a principal innovator of novel methods for
relatively "un-vizzed" problems, including visualizing categorical [@Friendly:00:VCD; @FriendlyMeyer:2016:DDAR,]
and those for multivariate data, the subject of this book. Along with this, he is the author and maintainer of many R packages,
described on his [GitHub R packages page](https://github.com/friendly/friendly/blob/main/packages.md).

His passion for the deep roots of modern graphical methods led him to become an world-known amateur historian of data visualization. 
In the latter, he directs [The Milestones Project](http://www.datavis.ca/milestones/), a comprehensive catalog and database of the principal developments in the histories of thematic cartography, statistical graphics and data visualization. 
He is a founder of an international group, _Les Chevaliers des Albums de Statistique Graphique_, devoted to this history and
is author of multiple books and research papers on these topics. His most recent book in this area is @FriendlyWainer:2021:TOGS [_A History of Data Visualization and Graphic Communication_](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674975231), Harvard University Press (2021).



<!--
data visualization specialist and enthusiast, with an academic background 
  in mathematics and statistics. She holds a PhD in Statistics and Operational Research, which focused on analysing and visualising 
  transport demand. She is particularly interested in how we use data visualization to communicate complex, 
  quantitative information in an accessible way, as well as the intersection of visualization and art. 
  She has experience of teaching at both undergraduate and postgraduate level, in courses covering fundamentals of data science, 
  statistical methods, and programming. Nicola has also previously worked in data science consultancy, and 
  delivered training courses covering topics including advanced data visualization with R, statistical modelling, and 
  reproducible reporting. She is the author and maintainer of several R packages, including multiple **`ggplot2`** extension packages. Nicola is a regular speaker at R and data science meetups, has been the chapter organizer of R-Ladies Lancaster, and part of the R-Ladies Global Team. She is co-author of the Royal Statistical Society's [*Best Practices for Data Visualisation Guide*](https://royal-statistical-society.github.io/datavisguide/), and is an active member of the Royal Statistical Society. Several of her data visualizations have been long-listed at the Information is Beautiful Awards.
