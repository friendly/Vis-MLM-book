# Overview of Linear models {#sec-linear-models}

Although this book is primarily about multivariate models, it is useful to have an overview of the range of available
techniques to see their relations and to appreciate how univariate response models generalize to multivariate ones.
Hence, this chapter reviews the characteristics of the standard univariate methods for explaining or predicting
a single outcome variable from a set of predictors.

The key ideas are:

* For a single quantitative outcome variable $\mathbf{y}$, methods of linear regression and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are comprised within a single framework of the **general linear model** (GLM). Regression and ANOVA differ only in that the predictors in the former are quantitative, while those in the latter are discrete factors. They can all be fit using
`lm()`.

* These models extend directly to the multivariate case of $q > 1$ outcomes, $\mathbf{Y} = (\mathbf{y}_1, \mathbf{y}_2, \dots \mathbf{y}_q)$, and are also fit using `lm()`.

* A binary outcome $y = (0, 1)$ and categorical outcomes like marital status ("never married", "married", "separated", "divorced") can be handled within a different extension, the **generalized** linear model as logistic regression
or multinomial regression, fit using `glm()`.

* All of these models involve linear combinations of predictors (weighted sums) fit to optimize some criterion.

* Models and data can be more easily understood with graphics, and many statistical ideas have a visual representation in geometry.

@fig-techniques summarizes a variety of methods for linear models, classified by number of predictors and number of response variables, and whether these are quantitative vs. discrete.
