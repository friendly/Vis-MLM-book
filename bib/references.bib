@article{Emerson-etal:2013,
	Abstract = {This article develops a generalization of the scatterplot matrix based on the recognition that most datasets include both categorical and quantitative information. Traditional grids of scatterplots often obscure important features of the data when one or more variables are categorical but coded as numerical. The generalized pairs plot offers a range of displays of paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. A mosaic plot, fluctuation diagram, or faceted bar chart may be used to display two categorical variables. A side-by-side boxplot, stripplot, faceted histogram, or density plot helps visualize a categorical and a quantitative variable. A traditional scatterplot is suitable for displaying a pair of numerical variables, but options also support density contours or annotating summary statistics such as the correlation and number of missing values, for example. By combining these, the generalized pairs plot may help to reveal structure in multivariate data that otherwise might go unnoticed in the process of exploratory data analysis. Two different R packages provide implementations of the generalized pairs plot, gpairs and GGally. Supplementary materials for this article are available online on the journal web site.},

  abstract   = {When political scientists present empirical results, they are much more likely to use tables than graphs, despite the fact that graphs greatly increases the clarity of presentation and makes it easier for a reader to understand the data being used and to draw clear and correct inferences. Using a sample of leading journals, we document this tendency and suggest reasons why researchers prefer tables. We argue that the extra work required in producing graphs is rewarded by greatly enhanced presentation and communication of empirical results. We illustrate their benefits by turning several published tables into graphs, including tables that present descriptive data and regression results. We show that regression graphs emphasize point estimates and confidence intervals and that they can successfully present the results of regression models. A move away from tables towards graphs would improve the discipline&apos;s communicative output and make empirical findings more accessible to every type of audience.
We have created a web site, tables2graphs.com, that contains complete replication code for all the graphs that appear in this article, as well as additional graphs that we did not present due to space limitations.},

The possible effects of factors which could modify the nature of these responses (obesity, age, sex, family history of diabetes, and indications for performing the tolerance test) have been extensively evaluated. None of these variables were found to have a statistically significant effect on the plasma glucose and insulin responses. Two general relationships between glucose and insulin responses have been defined within the population studied. One, based on the quantitative aspects of the glucose and insulin responses, indicated that there was at first an increase, and then, a decrease in the insulin response to progressive degrees of hyperglycemia. The second relationship was independent of the absolute concentrations of either glucose and insulin, and states that the pattern of glucose response during the three hours of the tolerance test determines the pattern of the insulin response during this same time interval.},

  abstract = {Bartlett's modified likelihood ratio statistic is often suggested
	in multivariate analysis for testing equality of covariance matrices.
	Unfortunately, the chisquare approximation to the null distribution of - 2 log
	? is useful only when the data is normally distributed. This article presents
	a pooled bootstrap procedure that replaces the chisquare approximation and
	makes Bartlett's statistic a useful tool for data analysis. This procedure
	also applies to most quadratic form test statistics.},
