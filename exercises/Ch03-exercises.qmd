::: {#exr-salary-smooth}
  
Using the `r dataset("Salaries")` dataset, create one or more plots to compare different smoothing methods for the relationship between `yrs.since.phd` and `salary` shown in @fig-Salaries-discipline. Include linear regression, quadratic polynomial, and loess smoothers, 

```r
library(ggplot2)
data(Salaries, package = "carData")
# Your code here
```

::: {#exr-salary-smooth2}

One alternative to a loess smooth, which allows a `span` argument to control the degree of smoothing
is a **natural spline**, that can be used in `geom_smooth()` using the argument `formula = y ~ splines::ns(x, df=)`,
where `df` is the equivalent number of degrees of freedom for the spline smoother. Re-do @exr-salary-smooth,
but trying out this smoothing method for several values of `df`.
