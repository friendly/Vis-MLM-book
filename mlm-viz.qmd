# Visualizing Multivariate Models {#sec-vis-mlm}

Tests of multivariate models, including multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) for group differences and multivariate multiple regression (MMRA) can be easily visualized by plots of a hypothesis ("H") data ellipse for the fitted values relative to the corresponding plot of the error ellipse ("E") of the residuals, which I call the HE plot framework.

For more than a few response variables, these result can be projected onto a lower-dimensional "canonical discriminant" space providing an even simpler description.

## HE plot framework {#sec-he-framework}

@sec-Hotelling illustrated the basic ideas of the framework for visualizing multivariate
linear models in the context of a simple two group design, using Hotelling's $T^2$.  These are illustrated in @fig-HE-framework.

* In data space, each group is summarized by its **data ellipse**, representing the means and covariances.

* Variation against the hypothesis of equal means can be seen by the $\mathbf{H}$ ellipse in the **HE plot**, representing the data ellipse of the fitted values. Error variance is shown in the $\mathbf{E}$ ellipse,
representing the pooled within-group covariance matrix, $\mathbf{S}_p$ and the data ellipse of the residuals from the model.

* The MANOVA (or Hotelling's $T^2$) is formally equivalent to a **discriminant analysis**, predicting
group membership from the response variables which can be seen in data space.

* This effectively projects the $p$-dimensional
space of the predictors into the smaller **canonical space** that shows the greatest differences among
the groups.

For more complex models such as MANOVA with multiple factors or multivariate multivariate regression,
there is one $\mathbf{H}$ ellipse for each term in the model. ...
