# Visualizing Multivariate Models

## HE plot framework

Chapter @sec-Hotelling illustrated the basic ideas of the framework for visualizing multivariate
linear models in the context of a simple two group design, using Hotelling's $T^2$.  These are illustrated in @fig-HEframework.

* In data space, each group is summarized by its data ellipse, representing the means and covariances.

* Variation against the hypothesis of equal means can be seen by the $\mathbf{H}$ ellipse in the HE plot, representing the data ellipse of the fitted values. Error variance is shown in the $\mathbf{E}$ ellipse,
representing the pooled within-group covariance matrix, $\mathbf{S}_p$ and the data ellipse of the residuals from the model.

* The MANOVA (or Hotelling's $T^2) is formally equivalent to a discriminant analysis, predicting
group membership from the response variables. This effectively projects the $p$-dimensional
space of the predictors into the smaller canonical space that shows the greatest differences among
the groups.

For more complex models such as MANOVA with multiple factors or multivariate multivariate regression,
there is one $\mathbf{H}$ ellipse for each term in the model. ...
