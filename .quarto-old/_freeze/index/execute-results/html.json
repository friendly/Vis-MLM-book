Univariate numerical summaries are means, medians, measures of variablilty, and so forth. Univariate displays include dot plots, boxplots, histograms and density estimates.\n-   **bivariate**: two variables, considered jointly. Numerical summaries include correlations, covariances and two-way tables of frequencies or measures of association for categorical variables. Bivariate displays include scatterplots and mosaic plots.\n-   **multivariate**: three or more variables, considered jointly. Numerical summaries include correlation and covariance matrices, consisting of all pairwise values, but also derived measures from the analysis of these matrices (eigenvalues, eigenvectors). Graphical displays of multivariate data can sometimes be shown in\n3D, but often involve multiple views of the data projected into 2D plots.\n\nAs a quasi-numerical scale, I refer to these as **1D**, **2D** and **nD**. This admits the possibility of half-integer cases, such as 1.5D, where the main focus is on a single variable, but it is classified by a simple factor (gender). His point in this classification was that once you reached three variables, all higher dimensions involved similar summaries and data displays.\n\nUnivariate and bivariate methods and displays are well-known.  This book is about how these ideas can\nbe extended to an $n$-dimensional world. Three-dimensional data displays are now fairly easy to produce,\neven if they are sometimes difficult to understand. But how can we even think about four or more dimensions?\nThe difficulty can be appreciated by considering the tale of _Flatland_.\n\n\n\n\n## Flatland\n\n> To comport oneself with perfect propriety in Polygonal society, one ought to be a Polygon oneself.\n> --- Edwin A. Abbott, _Flatland_\n\nIn 1884, an English schoolmaster, Edwin Abbott Abbott, shook the world of Victorian culture with a \nslim volume, _Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions_ [@Abbott:1884]. He described a two-dimensional world, _Flatland_,\ninhabited entirely by geometric figures in the plane. His purpose was satirical, to poke fun at the \nsocial and gender class system at the time:\nWomen were mere line segments, while men were represented as polygons with varying numbers of sides--- \na triangle was a working man; gentlemen and professionals had more sides.\nAbbot published this under the pseudonym, \"A Square\", suggesting his place in the hierarchy.\n\n> True, said the Sphere; it appears to you a Plane, because you are not accustomed to light and shade and\n> perspective; just as in Flatland a Hexagon would appear a Straight Line to one who has not the Art of Sight\n> Recognition. But in reality it is a Solid, as you shall learn by the sense of Feeling.\n> --- Edwin A. Abbott,  _Flatland_\n\n\nBut how did it feel to be a member of a flatland society? How could a point (a child?) understand a\nline (a woman)?  How does a Triangle \"see\" a Hexagon or even a infinitely-sided Circle?\nAbbott introduces these ideas through dreams and visions: \n\n* A Square dreams of visiting a one-dimensional\n_Lineland_ where men appear as lines, and women are merely \"illustrious points\", but the inhabitants\ncan only see the Square as lines. \n\n* In another vision, the Square is visited by a Sphere, to illustrate\nwhat a 2D flatlander could understand from a 3D sphere.\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A 2D flatlander seeing a sphere pass through Flatland.

In two Dimensions, did not\n> a moving Line produce a Square with four terminal points? In Three Dimensions, did not a moving Square produce\n> - did not the eyes of mine behold it - that blessed being, a Cube, with eight terminal points? And in Four\n> Dimensions, shall not a moving Cube - alas, for Analogy, and alas for the Progress of Truth if it be not so -\n> shall not, I say the motion of a divine Cube result in a still more divine organization with sixteen terminal\n> points?\n> --- Edwin A. Abbott\n\nFor Abbot, the way for a citizen of any world to image one more dimension was to consider how a\nhigher-dimensional object would change over time. However, as far back as 1754 [@Cajori:1926],\nthe idea of adding a fourth dimension appears in Jean le Rond d'Alembert's \"Dimensions\",\nand one realization of a four-dimensional object is a _tesseract_, shown in the figure below.\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Geometrical object in 1 to 4 dimensions](images/1D-4D.png){#fig-1D-4D fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\nBut to really see a tesseract you have to view it in an animation over time:\n::: {#fig-tesseract}\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"images/tesseract.gif\"></iframe>\n</center>\n\nAnimation of a tesseract.\n:::\n\n\nYet the deep mathematics of more than three dimensions only emerged in the 19th century.\nIn Newtonian mechanics, space and time were always considered independent of each other. \nOur familiar three-dimensional space, of length, width, and height had formed the backbone of Euclidean geometry for millenea.\nHowever, the idea that space and time are indeed interwoven was first proposed by German mathematician Hermann Minkowski (1864--1909) in 1908. This was a powerful idea. It bore fruit when\nAlbert Einstein revolutionized the Newtonian conceptions of gravity in 1915 when he presented a theory of general relativity which was based primarily on the fact that mass and energy warp the fabric of four-dimensional spacetime.\n\nThe parable of _Flatland_ can provide inspiration for statistical thinking and data visualization.\nOnce we go beyond bivariate statistics and 2D plots, we are in a multivariate world of\npossibly MANY dimensions. It takes only some imagination and suitable methods to get there.\n\n\n\n## EUREKA!\n\nEven modest sized multivariate data can have secrets that can be revealed in the right view.\nAs an example, David Coleman at RCA Laboratories in Princeton, N.J. generated a data set of\nfive (fictitious) measurements of grains of pollen for the 1986 Data Exposition at the\nJoint statistical Meetings.\nThe first three variables are the lengths of geometric features 3848 observed sampled pollen grains -- in the x, y, and z dimensions: a `ridge` along x, a `nub` in the y\ndirection, and a `crack` in along the z dimension.  The fourth\nvariable is pollen grain `weight`, and the fifth is `density`.\nThe challenge was to \"find something interesting\" in this data set.\n\nThose who solved the puzzle were able to find an orientation of this 5-dimensional data set, such that\nzooming in revealed a magic word, \"EUREKA\" spelled in points, as in the following figure.\n\n::: {#fig-pollen-eureka layout-nrow=2}\n![](images/pollen-eureka1.png){width=40%}\n\n![](images/pollen-eureka2.png){width=40%}\n\n![](images/pollen-eureka4.png){width=40%}\n\n![](images/pollen-eureka3.png){width=40%}\n\nFour views of the `pollen` data, zooming in, clockwise from the upper left to discover the word \"EUREKA\".\n\n:::\n\nThis can be seen better in a 3D animation. `rgl` [@R-rgl] is used to create a 3D scatterplot of the first three\nvariables. Then the `animation` package [@R-animation] is use to record a sequence of images, adjusting the\n`rgl::par3d(zoom)` value.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(animation)\nlibrary(rgl)\ndata(pollen, package = \"animation\")\noopt = ani.options(interval = 0.05)\n## adjust the viewpoint\nuM =\n  matrix(c(-0.370919227600098, -0.513357102870941,\n           -0.773877620697021, 0, -0.73050606250763, 0.675815105438232,\n           -0.0981751680374146, 0, 0.573396027088165, 0.528906404972076,\n           -0.625681936740875, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1), 4, 4)\nopen3d(userMatrix = uM, \n       windowRect = c(10, 10, 510, 510))\n\nplot3d(pollen[, 1:3])\n\n# zoom in\nzm = seq(1, 0.045, length = 200)\npar3d(zoom = 1)\nfor (i in 1:length(zm)) {\n  par3d(zoom = zm[i])\n  ani.pause()\n}\nani.options(oopt)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-pollen-eureka-fig}\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"images/pollen-eureka.gif\"></iframe>\n</center>\n\nAnimation of zooming in on the `pollen` data.\n:::\n\n## What I assume\n\nI assume the reader to have at least a basic familiarity with R.\nWhile R fundamentals are outside the scope of the current paper, I believe that this language provides a rich set of resources, far beyond that offered by other statistical software packages, and is well worth learning. \n\nFor those not familiar with R, I recommend @Matloff2011, @Wickham2014, and @Cotton2013 for introductions to programming in the language, and @FoxWeisberg:2018 and @Teetor2011 for learning about how to conduct basic statistical analyses. \n\n\n\n## Conventions\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n",
